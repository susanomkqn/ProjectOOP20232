"InvoiceMate and 24SEVEN Look to Offer Blockchain Financing Solutions to Thousands of UAE-Based SMEs","https://thefintechtimes.com/invoicemate-and-24seven-look-to-offer-blockchain-financing-solutions-to-thousands-of-uae-based-smes/","News Article","May 23, 2024","The Fintech Times, Manisha Patel, Francis Bignell, Tyler Pathe","InvoiceMate, a blockchain and AI-powered invoice financing enabler has agreed to support the retail supply chain across the UAE alongside retail technology provider 24SEVEN, as part of a new partnership. By partnering, InvoiceMate and 24SEVEN will potentially strengthen financial inclusion for thousands of SMEs by combining retail and payment data with blockchain financing solutions. UAE-based SMEs often face challenges with invoicing and cash flow. In fact, around 60 per cent of invoices are settled late and B2B payments take an average of over 40 days before they are settled. InvoiceMate’s blockchain invoicing and financing solutions will converge with 24SEVEN’s retail hardware and software technology, to enable new ways for retailers and their suppliers to manage capital. “It’s no secret that cash flow is critical, but until now it’s been particularly difficult for SMEs in the UAE retail sector to access the financing they need,” said Jarrar Shah, co-founder and CEO of 24SEVEN. “We’re excited to bring InvoiceMate’s game-changing blockchain financing solutions to our retail partners. Through this partnership, we will be able to provide better access to finance for retailers and suppliers and support their daily operations.” With the UAE’s total annual retail market expected to broach $100billion by the end of 2024, innovative solutions to meet retailer and supplier needs can further bolster this economic upsurge. The power of blockchain financing 24SEVEN will enable real-time data at the Point-of-Sale (POS) through its Optima hardware devices and bespoke software, while credit scoring these stores using their AI-powered credit scoring application. InvoiceMate’s embedded financial technology will ‘plug in’ to enhance the options available for invoicing and working capital management. Muhammad Salman Anjum, founder and CEO of InvoiceMate, also added: “Combining 24SEVEN’s expertise and sales data, with InvoiceMate’s blockchain and AI technology is a winning combination to boost the UAE’s retail economy. Stakeholders across the retail supply chain will be able to access the cash they need, when they need it, and turbocharge their daily operations.” Blockchain financing provides a number of advantages over traditional invoicing processes. Firstly, it reduces the risk of fraud or manipulation, as invoices are recorded on a transparent, immutable and secure blockchain ledger. Processing is also faster, so decisions can be made quicker to provide businesses with the necessary working capital, improving liquidity for retail operations. And, by using real-time retail data directly from the point-of-sale rather than credit history or collateral, blockchain invoice financing can be more inclusive and flexible.

"Eurosystem Completes First of Many Experiments To Test DLT Central Bank Money Settlements","https://thefintechtimes.com/eurosystem-completes-first-of-many-experiments-to-test-dlt-central-bank-money-settlements/","News Article","May 18, 2024","The Fintech Times, The Fintech Times, The Fintech Times, Francis Bignell","Eurosystem, the monetary authority of the eurozone, has been exploring the possible use cases of distributed ledger technology (DLT) to conduct wholesale settlement in central bank money. It has now completed its first experiment using DLT, giving the monetary authority a glimpse into the potential merits of the tech. Over the next six months, onboarded companies will conduct trials and experiments on three Eurosystem interoperability-type solutions proposed for central bank money settlement of wholesale financial transactions recorded on DLT platforms. Furthermore, these tests will continue to explore the viability and benefits of actual central bank money settlement of wholesale financial transactions using DLT technologies. The European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks of the euro area are among the first central banks to delve into the viable use of the tech. Initially, 16 private companies will conduct trials involving actual settlement in central bank money. They will also experiment with mock settlement in test environments. The exploratory work will provide the Eurosystem with insights into how the TARGET Services and DLT platforms could interact in wholesale financial markets. Oesterreichische Nationalbank carried out the first experiment. It covered the tokenisation and simulated delivery-versus-payment (DvP) settlement of government bonds in a secondary market transaction against central bank money. Looking to the future Preparations for further trials and experiments are ongoing and will cover a variety of use cases. This includes DvP transactions in primary and secondary markets, securities lifecycle management, automated wholesale payments and payment-versus-payment transactions. A set of key performance indicators will be used to assess the results of the trials and experiments. The participating companies will perform the assessment in cooperation with Eurosystem. In December 2023 the Eurosystem launched a call for expression of interest in exploratory work on the three interoperability solutions proposed by the Eurosystem and detailed these in the annexes to the notice. Edvards Margevics, co-partner at fintech company CONCRYT Commenting on Eurosystem’s trials, Edvards Margevics, co-partner at fintech company CONCRYT, the payments and banking fintech: “As the Eurosystem embarks on these trials, we will hopefully witness a pivotal moment in the evolution of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. “Eurosystem is involving private companies and central banks in live trials. As a result, it is demonstrating a commitment to exploring innovative solutions for enhanced efficiency and security in financial markets. These trials offer valuable insights into the potential benefits of DLT integration in wholesale financial transactions. They are also paving the way for future advancements in blockchain infrastructure. “However, Eurosystem’s exploratory work does not necessarily constitute a commitment to provide any steady-state solution(s) in the future. Nor does it need to make any changes to its current infrastructure. The responsibility for making DLT a success is on industry players. Additionally, if the market wants to go in this direction, it is on the ECB to find out what the cost-benefit of any solution will be. Therefore, the entire crypto industry will be interested in the outcome of these trials.” What does the successful trial mean for the fintech industry? Neil Vernon, CTO, Gresham Technologies Neil Vernon, chief product and innovation officer at Gresham Technologies, a global fintech company specialising in mission-critical data and automation solutions for the finance industry, commented on the announcement saying: “Eurosystem’s successful trial indicates that the fintech sector is setting up for significant change in the next five to 10 years. “Systems will improve, speed up and carry more ability than ever before. With T+1 settlement times entering the fray, and huge advancements in AI and automation shaping how we view technology, the fintech we know today could be unrecognisable sooner than we expect.” Robert Brown, head of strategic development at MAS Markets “The Eurosystem’s successful experiment with new technologies for settling wholesale transactions in central bank money marks a significant step toward modernising financial infrastructures,” said Robert Brown, head of strategic development at MAS Markets, the flexible multi-asset liquidity firm. “By involving 16 private companies, the trial explored both actual and mock settlements. “DLT offers potential benefits such as increased efficiency, reduced reliance on intermediaries, and enhanced compliance through transparent, immutable transaction records. These advancements could aid in monitoring cross-border payments and reducing fraud. However, DLT adoption may require central banks to adjust their infrastructures, enabling DLT platforms to interface with existing systems or offering central bank money in a DLT-compatible form.” The potential of DLT Jorge Lesmes, senior director and client partner, banking at NTT DATA UK&I Jorge Lesmes, senior director and client partner, banking at NTT DATA UK&I, said: “Eurosystem’s successful trial underscores the potential of DLT to revolutionise wholesale transactions by enhancing efficiency, security, and transparency. “However, to achieve broader adoption of DLT, several steps remain. Firstly, regulatory frameworks need to be harmonised across jurisdictions to provide clarity and assurance to market participants. Secondly, the industry must invest in interoperability solutions to ensure seamless integration with existing financial systems. Lastly, robust cybersecurity measures are crucial to safeguard the integrity of DLT-based platforms. “Eurosystem’s trial signals to the fintech sector that DLT is no longer a theoretical concept but a practical solution with tangible benefits. This successful experiment will likely spur further innovation and investment in DLT, accelerating its adoption across the industry and paving the way for more advanced applications in financial transactions.” Author The Fintech Times The Fintech Times","Blockchain Europe Trending Weekend Read",", , , , , , , DLT, European Central Bank, 16 private companies, exploratory work, key performance indicators, call for expression of interest, Edvards Margevics, Neil Vernon, Jorge Lesmes, The Fintech Times, , , , , , , , "
