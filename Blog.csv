"A $16 Trillion worth Asset Tokenization: Future Frontier of Investing","https://blockchainshiksha.com/opportunity-asset-tokenization/","Blog Post","25/02/2024","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","A $16 Trillion Opportunity – Tokenization: The Future Frontier of Asset Investing A Paradigm Shift in Asset Management Financial markets stand at the precipice of a transformative era. According to a new report by Boston Consulting Group, the tokenization of real-world assets has the staggering potential to capture a market value of $16 trillion by 2030. That’s not a typo. This seismic shift heralds an unparalleled opportunity for investors and enterprises alike, promising to rewrite the playbook on asset liquidity, ownership, and investment strategy. So, what are you doing to prepare for this tectonic shift? Illiquidity: The Obsolete Constraint In traditional investments, over 50% of global assets are illiquid, locked in inefficiencies like high barriers to entry, lack of price transparency, and limited trading hours. These challenges have long been the bane of portfolio diversification and asset management. Tokenization has the unprecedented potential to alleviate these concerns, fundamentally changing how we perceive and manage assets. Unlocking Liquidity: The Mechanics of Tokenization How can we elevate a real estate property or a piece of artwork from a static asset to a liquid, easily tradable commodity? The answer lies in tokenization. Assets are digitized and represented as tokens on blockchain networks, enabling 24/7 trading and fractional ownership. No more hefty entry tickets; you can own a fraction of a lucrative property or a promising start-up. The High-Stakes Players: Where the Numbers Are J.P. Morgan projects debt, equity, and real estate as the most ripe sectors for tokenization, together accounting for over $4 trillion of the estimated $5 trillion tokenized market. Financial assets, real estate, and infrastructure are slated to dominate this market, capturing over $14 trillion of the potential $16 trillion pie. This leaves room for commodities, art, intellectual property, and other niche sectors to make up the remainder. The Regulatory Gauntlet: Challenges and Triumphs No revolution is without its challenges, and tokenization is no exception. The regulatory landscape is still a work in progress, with institutions playing catch-up to technological advancements. Yet, progressive policy frameworks are in the pipeline, and early adopters could stand to reap monumental benefits. We cannot overstate the importance of a receptive regulatory environment for the growth of asset tokenization. As McKinsey & Company pointed out, a coherent, supportive legal framework is essential for widespread adoption. Regulatory authorities worldwide are actively working to catch up with these rapid developments. The SEC in the U.S., ESMA in Europe, and similar bodies in Asia are constantly revising their stances, striving to balance encouraging innovation and ensuring investor protection. The Role of Consensus: Community and Governance In the world of decentralized finance, governance extends beyond regulatory bodies to the community of users themselves. Token holders often have a say in developing and managing the tokenized asset, whether it’s real estate or a financial instrument. This new model of collective governance could yield more inclusive and equitable investment ecosystems, although it also brings up questions about the risks and responsibilities involved. Fiat Entry: The Elephant in the Room One immediate concern is the initial buy-in. Most tokenized assets require purchase via cryptocurrencies, posing an obstacle for traditional investors. But let’s remember that fiat on-ramps are evolving and will likely improve synchronously with rising demand and regulatory clarity. Global Reach: Democratizing Investments Tokenization eliminates geographical constraints, allowing investors to tap into diverse economies and asset classes. From real estate in New York to renewable energy projects in Australia, your investment universe has just expanded exponentially. Imagine building a portfolio that balances asset types across global economies, potentially hedging against geopolitical risks. The opportunity for a new age of diversification is real and imminent. An Unprecedented ROI: Time-Sensitive Opportunities Investing in tokenized assets is also the opportunity to pioneer a market. Early entrants stand to gain from both asset appreciation and the burgeoning ecosystem around tokenized assets, from secondary markets to derivative products. You’re not just investing in an investment; you’re investing in the future of asset management. Your Next Steps: Beyond Speculation The data is in, the projections are robust, and the potential is immense. The question is no longer if but how tokenization will impact your asset management strategy. Will you seize this chance to diversify, improve liquidity, and pioneer an emerging market? Or will you observe from the fringes as others seize the opportunity? In Conclusion: Act Now, Reap Later The $16 trillion opportunity on the horizon isn’t just a compelling figure; it’s a call to action. Tokenization is set to redefine asset management in ways we are only beginning to understand. Those who act early could define the trajectory of this market and position themselves at the vanguard of the next wave of financial innovation. Seize this unparalleled opportunity. Shape the future of asset investment. Make your move. How do you envision tokenization influencing your asset management strategy in the coming half-decade?

The Evolution of Digital Ownership: NFTs and Creator Coins Imagine owning a piece of the Mona Lisa, a rare comic book, or even a tweet from your favorite celebrity. Sounds improbable! Well, not in the Web 3.0 era, where NFTs reign supreme. Non-Fungible Tokens, or NFTs, have taken the digital world by storm, providing a means for artists, musicians, and creators of all kinds to tokenize their digital creations, proving unequivocally that in the age of blockchain, ownership can be as tangible as holding a physical object. But NFTs are just the tip of the iceberg. Creator Coins, an ingenious offspring of blockchain technology, further bolsters the empowerment of creators. These personalized cryptocurrencies allow artists and influencers to create economies where fans can invest in their favorite creators’ success. The value of these coins isn’t solely financial; they represent a deeper, more profound connection between creators and their communities. In this blog, we’ll delve into the fascinating world of NFTs, Creator Coins, and the Web 3.0 revolution, exploring how they’re shifting the power dynamic from centralized gatekeepers to the very creators who have long been the lifeblood of the digital landscape. Join us on this exhilarating journey as we witness the evolution of digital ownership and the rise of a new era where creators truly rule the virtual kingdom. NFTs: Redefining Digital Ownership In the ever-evolving landscape of the digital age, blockchain enthusiasts and tech-savvy visionaries are witnessing a revolution reshaping how we perceive and value digital assets. At the heart of this transformation are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), digital assets that have taken the world by storm and are redefining the concept of digital ownership. Buckle up as we delve into the captivating realm of NFTs and how they shape the digital world’s future. Understanding Non-Fungible Tokens Let’s start with the basics. In a world dominated by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, where every unit is interchangeable, NFTs are unique digital assets. Non-fungible means they cannot be exchanged one-to-one, making each NFT one-of-a-kind. This uniqueness is the secret sauce behind NFTs, empowering creators to attach scarcity and value to their digital creations. Imagine owning a digital masterpiece, like a rare Picasso painting, but in the form of a digital file. That’s what NFTs offer – a certificate of ownership for a digital item. The blockchain, a decentralized and tamper-proof ledger, authenticates and records these tokens, guaranteeing the authenticity and provenance of the asset. NFTs in the Creative Sphere NFTs are not limited to static digital art; they encompass a vast creative universe. Musicians, writers, gamers, and even social media influencers have embraced NFTs to monetize their work. Musicians release albums as NFTs, granting fans the music and a unique piece of digital memorabilia. Authors are minting NFTs of their books, giving readers a tangible connection to the digital words they consume. Gaming is another arena where NFTs are making waves. In-game items, skins, and characters can be tokenized, allowing players to buy, sell, and trade them in a decentralized marketplace. This newfound digital ownership adds an exciting dimension to the gaming experience, as players can now own their virtual assets. The Economics of NFTs The NFT ecosystem has opened doors to new economic possibilities, empowering creators with revenue streams that were previously unimaginable. When an artist mints an NFT, they can program in royalties, ensuring a percentage of future sales goes directly to them. This transforms the traditional creator-fan relationship, enabling ongoing support and appreciation for their work. Moreover, the NFT marketplace is accessible to a global audience, democratizing art and creativity. Artists no longer need intermediaries like galleries or publishers to reach their audience and monetize their work. This shift in power from intermediaries to creators has far-reaching implications, creating a more inclusive and artist-centric creative landscape. We can say that NFTs are not just digital assets; they symbolize a fundamental shift in the digital world, a transition towards Web 3.0 where creators are at the forefront. The power dynamics are changing, and the digital realm is becoming a place where creators can genuinely thrive, connecting with their audience personally and reaping the rewards of their creativity. As blockchain enthusiasts, we are witnessing the dawn of a new era where ownership is redefined, and the digital world has become a playground for creators and collectors alike. So, keep your eyes on the blockchain – the future of digital ownership is being reshaped by NFTs, and it’s a sight to behold. Creator Coins: Monetizing Influence Unlike their non-fungible counterparts, Creator Coins are all about fungibility and accessibility. Think of them as a personalized currency tied directly to a creator’s reputation and influence. This novel concept allows creators to monetize their content, engage with their audience on a deeper level, and gain a more equitable share of the value they generate. Imagine a world where your favorite content creator, let’s call them “CryptoMaestro,” mints their very own Creator Coin. Each coin represents a stake in their digital empire, and fans can purchase and trade these coins on the blockchain. As CryptoMaestro’s influence grows, so does the demand for their Creator Coin, creating a thriving ecosystem that rewards creators and supporters. NFTs vs. Creator Coins: A Comparative Analysis At first glance, NFTs and Creator Coins may seem similar, but they cater to different facets of the digital creator’s journey. NFTs tokenize unique digital assets, like artwork or collectibles, while Creator Coins tokenize the creators themselves. Here’s a comparative breakdown: NFTs: Tokenize unique, one-of-a-kind digital assets. Often used for art, music, virtual real estate, and collectibles. Ownership is a crucial feature, emphasizing scarcity. Creator Coins: Tokenize the creator’s reputation and influence. Enable fans to invest in the creator’s success. Foster a sense of community and shared success. Where NFTs celebrate the uniqueness of digital creations, Creator Coins are all about celebrating the creators behind those creations. They allow fans to have a stake in their favorite creator’s journey, creating a powerful bond between them. For blockchain enthusiasts, this revolution is like witnessing the birth of a new internet, where power dynamics have shifted. Creators are no longer solely dependent on advertising revenues or sponsorship deals; they have a direct line to monetizing their influence, all thanks to Creator Coins. Creator Coins are the torchbearers of a revolution redefining the creator-fan relationship. They empower creators to take control of their destiny, foster deeper connections with their audience, and turn their influence into a thriving economy. As blockchain technology continues to reshape our digital world, Creator Coins are at the forefront, leading the charge toward a more equitable and creator-centric future. Decentralization: The Heartbeat of Web 3.0 Blockchain enthusiasts, rejoice! Web 3.0 is not just an upgrade; it’s a paradigm shift. Decentralization is the game’s name and the ace up the sleeve of creators. Traditional platforms have long held sway over content distribution and monetization. But now, thanks to blockchain technology, creators can sidestep these gatekeepers and go straight to their audience. Challenges and Considerations: Navigating the Uncharted Waters Of course, as with any revolution, there are challenges and considerations. The world of NFTs and Creator Coins is still relatively new, and its rapid growth has smoothened some rough edges. Scalability, energy consumption, and the environmental impact of blockchain are issues that need careful attention. Moreover, NFTs redefined the question of ownership in the digital age. Owning an NFT doesn’t always equate to owning the copyright or physical rights to the underlying content. Creators and buyers alike must navigate this complex terrain with eyes wide open.

In this blog, we embark on a journey through the intricate world of cryptography and digital signatures, exploring their pivotal role in preserving the integrity of our digital lives. Join us as we delve into the depths of these cryptographic technologies and unravel the secrets behind their unwavering commitment to securing the digital frontier. What Is Cryptography? Cryptography, the art of securing information, employs mathematical algorithms to encode data. It ensures that only intended recipients can access and understand the information. It’s like using an unbreakable code to safeguard your messages from prying eyes, making digital communication secure and private. Types of Cryptography There are various types of cryptography, including symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. In contrast, Symmetric cryptography employs a single key for encryption and decryption, while asymmetric cryptography employs a pair of keys—a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Advantages of Cryptography There are a lot of good things about cryptography in the blockchain. Here are some of them: Encryption: Asymmetric encryption is used in cryptography to ensure that transactions on their network protect information and communications from being shared or accessed by people who shouldn’t be able to. Immutability: This cryptography function is essential for blockchain because it allows blocks to secure links to other blocks and ensures that the data stored in the blockchain is correct. It also provides that an attacker can’t get a valid signature for unopposed queries and the signatures that go with them from previous queries. Security: Cryptography makes it easy to keep track of transactions by using public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt data. Cryptographic hashing makes changing data impossible, making the blockchain safer. Scalability: Cryptography ensures that no one can alter the transaction and gives all users confidence that the digital ledger is correct. You can safely record an unlimited number of transactions on the network. Non-repudiation: A digital signature offers a service called “non-repudiation,” which keeps the sender’s message from being turned down. This benefit can be linked to collision resistance, which means that because each input value has its hash function, there is no chance that two messages sent simultaneously will have the same hash value. This feature makes it easy to tell one message from another. Keep hackers away: Hackers can’t change the data with a digital signature because if the data is changed, the digital signature is no longer valid. It uses cryptography to keep hackers from getting to data, making cryptography on the blockchain impossible to stop. How Cryptography Works Cryptography works by transforming plaintext data into ciphertext through encryption. This process uses complex mathematical functions and keys, making the encrypted data nearly impossible to decode without the corresponding key.

"Blockchain Security: Safeguarding the Future of Digital Trust","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-blockchain-security/","Blog Post","22/05/2023","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","In the ever-evolving landscape of digital transactions, blockchain technology has emerged as a game-changer, promising enhanced security and transparency. However, despite its immense potential, the developing nature of blockchain has made it a target for malicious actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities. In this blog, we will discuss the critical topic of security in blockchain, exploring the initiatives taken and those yet to be adopted to fortify the integrity of this groundbreaking technology. Table of Contents • Understanding Blockchain Vulnerabilities • Cryptography and Blockchain Security • Promising Blockchain Security Initiatives • Notable Security Breach Events • The Future of Blockchain Security • Conclusion Understanding Blockchain Vulnerabilities: Before we explore the measures to enhance blockchain security, let’s first identify the vulnerabilities that threaten its foundation. While the decentralized nature of blockchain inherently provides a robust security framework, specific weak points require attention. These include: 1) Smart Contract Vulnerabilities: Smart contracts are self-executing digital contracts with predefined rules and conditions executed automatically when specific criteria are met. They are fundamental to many blockchain platforms, facilitating trustless and transparent transactions. However, bugs or coding errors in smart contracts can lead to exploits, as witnessed in the infamous DAO attack of 2016. The attack exploited a vulnerability in the smart contract code, allowing hackers to siphon off a significant amount of funds. Comprehensive smart contract auditing and code reviews are essential to identify and rectify vulnerabilities before deployment to address this issue. 2) Insider Threats: While blockchain’s consensus mechanisms are designed to prevent single points of failure, the risk of malicious actors infiltrating the network or dishonest participants colluding to compromise security remains. The decentralized nature of blockchain mitigates this risk to some extent, but careful attention must be paid to identity management and access controls. Implementing robust authentication mechanisms and conducting thorough background checks can help reduce the likelihood of insider threats. 3) 51% Attack: In a proof-of-work blockchain, a 51% attack happens when any single entity or group controls most of the network’s mining power. This dominance allows them to manipulate transactions, undermine consensus, and potentially rewrite the blockchain’s history. Blockchain networks can explore alternative consensus mechanisms like proof-of-stake (PoS) or delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) to mitigate the risk of 51% attacks. These mechanisms distribute power more evenly among network participants, making it economically unfeasible for a single entity to gain control over the network. Cryptography and Blockchain Security Cryptography is an essential pillar of blockchain security, providing the fundamental tools and techniques to fortify the integrity and confidentiality of blockchain systems. As experts in blockchain technology, you know that blockchain networks’ decentralized nature necessitates robust security measures. Cryptography ensures secure authentication, data integrity, and confidentiality within the blockchain ecosystem. Blockchain networks can effectively protect against tampering, fraud, and unauthorized access by employing cryptographic hash functions, encryption methods, and digital signatures. These cryptographic principles enable participants to verify their identities, validate transactions, and establish trust in a trustless environment. As blockchain technology advances and finds its applications across various industries, cryptography will continue to be an indispensable ally in bolstering the security of these decentralized systems. B understanding the significance of cryptography in blockchain security, experts like you can contribute to advancing and adopting secure blockchain solutions, paving the way for a more trustworthy and transparent future. Promising Blockchain Security Initiatives: Several initiatives have been proposed and adopted. Let’s explore some of these measures To enhance security in blockchain and address the vulnerabilities. 1) Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Adding another layer of security to blockchain networks, MFA needs users to provide multiple forms of identification to access their accounts. This feature reduces the risk of unauthorized access and safeguards against credential theft. By combining something the user knows (e.g., a password), something the user possesses (e.g., a mobile device), and something the user is (e.g., biometric data), MFA significantly strengthens authentication mechanisms. 2) Encryption and Data Privacy: Blockchain protocols can employ advanced encryption techniques to protect sensitive information. Using cryptographic algorithms for data security and accessible only to authorized parties, minimizing the risk of data breaches. Privacy-focused cryptographic technologies like zero-knowledge proofs can enable transaction verification without revealing the underlying sensitive data, ensuring confidentiality while maintaining the integrity of the blockchain. 3) Penetration Testing: It involves regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities within blockchain networks. Conducting comprehensive assessments allows for the timely detection and mitigation of potential threats. Ethical hackers simulate real-world attack scenarios to uncover weaknesses in the system, providing valuable insights for security improvement. 4) Consensus Algorithm Enhancement: Blockchain networks can improve their consensus algorithms to address the risk of 51% of attacks. In a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, validators are chosen based on the number of cryptos they hold to create new blocks and validate transactions. They are willing to “stake” as collateral. This initiative reduces the incentive for malicious actors to gain control over the network, as they would need to acquire a significant portion of the cryptocurrency to manipulate the system. Delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) takes this further by allowing token holders to vote for delegates liable for transaction validation on their behalf. This distributed approach enhances security and makes it more difficult for any single entity to compromise the network. Notable Security Breach Events While blockchain technology holds immense promise, there have been notable security breaches that serve as cautionary tales. These incidents highlight the importance of robust security measures. Let’s take a closer look at a few prominent cases: 1) Mt. Gox Hack (2014): Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, suffered a security breach resulting in the loss of approximately 850,000 bitcoins. The incident revealed vulnerabilities in the exchange’s infrastructure, including poor security practices and inadequate safeguards. It served as a wake-up call for this industry, prompting the implementation of stricter security measures in cryptocurrency exchanges. 2) Parity Wallet Hack (2017): A vulnerability in Parity’s multi-signature wallet smart contract allowed hackers to freeze and drain approximately $30 million worth of Ethereum. The exploit highlighted the need for thorough, smart contract auditing and careful code implementation. Smart contract developers now prioritize security audits and rigorous testing to prevent similar incidents. 3) Binance Exchange Hack (2019): Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, experienced a security breach that led to the theft of 7,000 bitcoins, valued at over $40 million. The incident emphasized the significance of robust security measures in exchanges and safeguarding user funds. Since then, exchanges have implemented enhanced security protocols, including cold storage for funds, multi-signature wallets, and improved monitoring systems. The Future of Blockchain Security: As blockchain technology matures, the focus on fortifying its security framework intensifies. Here are a few emerging trends and potential initiatives that could shape the future of blockchain security: 1) Privacy-Enhancing Technologies: Innovations like zero-knowledge proofs and secure multiparty computation offer enhanced privacy options for blockchain networks. These technologies mitigate the risk of exposing sensitive information by masking transaction details and preserving anonymity. Privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash incorporate advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction privacy and unlinkability. 2) Formal Verification: Leveraging mathematical and logical methods and formal verification allows for the exhaustive analysis of smart contracts to ensure their correctness and security. Traditional software development practices rely on manual code reviews and testing, which may miss critical vulnerabilities. Formal verification provides a higher level of assurance by mathematically proving the correctness of smart contract code, reducing the possibility of exploits. 3) Decentralized Identity Management: Blockchain-based identity management systems offer secure, tamper-proof digital identities. Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials can reduce the reliance on centralized authorities, empowering individuals to have greater control over their personal data. With decentralized identity solutions, users can manage their identity information securely, selectively share data, and reduce the risk of identity theft and fraud. Conclusion: Blockchain technology can potentially revolutionize all sectors by providing secure and transparent solutions.

"NFTs Vs Cryptocurrency: What’s the difference","https://blockchainshiksha.com/learn-about-nfts-and-cryptocurrency/","Blog Post","12/04/2023","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Table of Contents • Crypto Vs NFT • What is Cryptocurrency? • What is NFT? • What distinguishes NFTs from cryptocurrencies? • Conclusion Crypto Vs NFT The terms “cryptocurrency” and “non-fungible tokens” (NFTs) have become ubiquitous in the last few years in the digital sphere. In this article, we will discuss NFT Vs crypto. Cryptocurrency is a decentralized digital currency that uses encryption techniques to control unit generation and verify fund transfers. NFTs, on the other hand, are one-of-a-kind digital assets that can only be replicated using blockchain technology. Both have grown in popularity in the world of digital assets, but they have distinct features that distinguish them. In this blog, we will look at the differences between cryptocurrency and NFTs and the characteristics that make each of them a valuable investment option. What is Cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrencies are virtual or digital currencies that employ encryption to prevent forgery or double-spending. Blockchain technology is the backbone of many cryptocurrency-based decentralized networks. It is a distributed ledger kept in order by a network of computers that are not connected. Because cryptocurrencies are often not given out by a central authority, the government might need help to control or change them. What is NFT? NFTs are tokens that are not fungible. As a result, unlike traditional cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, they cannot be exchanged for one another. Because each NFT is unique, they all have different values. NFTs are commonly used to represent digital objects such as music, art, and other virtual assets. They have grown in popularity because it is simple to buy, sell, and trade them on decentralized platforms. 2. Investing The primary distinction between crypto and NFT trading is that NFTs are non-fungible digital assets, so each NFT is unique and cannot be replaced by another NFT. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are fungible digital assets, which means that each cryptocurrency can be replaced with another cryptocurrency of the same value. When trading NFTs, one trades the asset itself, whereas when trading cryptocurrencies, one trades the asset’s underlying value. 3. Function The primary function of an NFT is to provide proof of ownership for a digital asset. NFTs can portray digital content like photos, videos, and audio files. NFTs can represent physical objects such as collectibles, works of art, collectibles, and even real estate. NFTs are ideal for defining ownership and authenticity because they are unique and cannot be replicated. NFTs are kept on a blockchain, which is a secure, distributed database that cannot be manipulated. If someone inquires about NFTs vs. blockchain, it is possible to explain that NFTs are blockchain-based tokens representing assets like art, digital content, or media. Cryptocurrencies, like traditional currencies such as the US dollar, are an exchange designed to exchange digital information while avoiding problems associated with conventional currencies. It allows for the purchase and payment of goods and services and quick, secure, and decentralized transactions. 4. Volatility When it comes to cryptocurrencies vs. NFTs, the former is frequently praised for its volatility. Although some see volatility as a positive, others see it as a significant negative. NFTs, on the other hand, are much more stable than cryptocurrencies because they are not subject to the same market forces. Instead, NFTs are valued on their own merits, meaning their prices are less susceptible to market volatility. 5. Applications and Markets One of the primary differences between NFTs and cryptocurrencies is that NFTs have been used for various purposes, such as digital art, gaming, and collectibles. In contrast, cryptocurrencies are primarily used for payment or investment. NFTs are typically purchased and sold on specialized marketplaces, whereas cryptocurrencies can be bought and sold on various exchanges. Kraken, Gemini, and Crypto.com are a few of the best Crypto Exchanges in the United States. What distinguishes NFTs from cryptocurrencies? NFTs are distinct in that they are not divisible, which means that they cannot be divided into smaller units like cryptocurrency. As a result, NFTs resemble physical assets like art or real estate, which can only be divided into whole units. When comparing blockchain to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the main difference is that NFTs store their information in the blockchain, which makes them more secure and open. Cryptocurrencies, however, are divisible and can be stored across various platforms. In terms of portability, cryptocurrencies are far superior to NFTs. Another distinction between NFT and cryptocurrency is that cryptocurrencies, unlike NFTs, can be used to purchase goods and services. Finally, cryptocurrency supply is not limited, whereas NFT supply is. When comparing NFTs and cryptocurrency, it is important to understand whether the currency is fungible or non-fungible. Cryptocurrency is a digital currency. It is fungible and has only economic value, like all other currencies. Regardless of which cryptocurrency token one owns, the value of any cryptocurrency token within a cryptocurrency is the same, i.e., 1 $ETH = 1 $ETH. NFTs are non-fungible, and their value transcends economics. Blockchain Solutions Architect Training courses can assist students in comprehending blockchains and their benefits. Advantages and disadvantages of NFTs? The following are some of the potential advantages of NFTs: The ability to create one-of-a-kind digital assets: Unlike traditional digital assets like JPEGs or MP3, NFTs can create one-of-a-kind digital assets, so NFTs have the potential to be more valuable than conventional digital assets. The ability to trace ownership and provenance: Tracing ownership and provenance is one of the most important advantages of NFTs. Because each NFT is stored on a blockchain, which is a public ledger, this is the case. Anyone can see who owns an NFT and where it came from. This transparency can potentially reduce fraud and boost trust in the NFT market. The ability to buy, sell, and trade NFTs easily: Another advantage of NFTs is the ease with which they can be bought, sold, and traded because of several dedicated NFT marketplaces, such as Open Sea and Rarible. These are NFT crypto platforms as well. This feature allows people to buy, sell, and trade NFTs without going through a central authority. There are several potential disadvantages to using NFTs. NFTs may launder money or engage in other illegal activities. NFTs, for example, could purchase illicit goods or services in some jurisdictions. NFTs may be used to avoid sanctions or trade restrictions. Another major concern is that NFTs could fund terrorism. NFTs, for example, could be used to donate anonymously to a terrorist organization. NFTs could be used to buy things that could be used in a terrorist attack, like weapons or other supplies. NFTs could facilitate child pornography or other forms of child exploitation. NFTs, for example, could be used to purchase child pornography anonymously or to solicit child sexual abuse material. Conclusion Finally, NFTs and cryptocurrencies have captured the world’s attention because they could disrupt traditional financial systems. While cryptocurrencies provide a decentralized, secure, and efficient financial transaction method, NFTs offer a distinct method of representing and exchanging digital assets. However, it is important to note that NFTs and cryptocurrencies are not interchangeable because they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. NFTs are primarily used for digital asset ownership and verification, whereas cryptocurrencies are used mainly for financial transactions. As a result, investors must understand the distinctions between the two and carefully consider their investment strategies. Finally, both NFTs and cryptocurrencies are exciting technologies that have the potential to reshape the financial landscape; only time will tell how they will be adopted and evolve in the future.

"What is Merkle Tree In Blockchain?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-merkle-tree-in-blockchain/","Blog Post","23/03/2023","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","If you haven’t heard of a “Merkel tree,” you must be missing one crucial concept. In all honesty, “Merkel tree,” a word that sounds too complicated, may sound like a tree named after a herb. Simply put, a Merkle Tree is a type of data structure that makes it easy and quick to check the accuracy of a large amount of data. Let’s look closer since they have become essential to blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Please read the article to learn about Merkle trees and what they mean for blockchain technology. What is the Merkel Tree? While the names “Merkle tree” and “Binary hash tree” are not well-known outside the cryptography community, they are not as complicated as they appear. Each leaf node receives the cryptographic hash of a data block label. Each non-leaf node is assigned the label of the cryptographic hash of its child nodes’ labels. Merkle trees are primarily binary, which means that each node in the tree has two offspring. They can, however, have additional child nodes. The hash-based mathematical data structure compiles the summaries of all transactions in a block. Rapid, secure content verification across large databases is also part of ensuring the consistency and quality of data. What is a Merkel Root? A Merkle root is the culmination of all hashes in the Merkle tree. The hashes of every transaction in a Merkle tree add to make the final hash, the Merkle root. Merkel root in Blockchain is easy to understand. Assume you start with 300 transactions and hash them down to 50, then 10, then 5, then 1 at the Merkle tree’s bottom. The final hash would represent all previous hashes in the group and serve as the transaction’s collective identity. A Merkle root can be used to mathematically confirm the data on a Merkle tree. In cryptocurrency, they are used to ensure that data blocks delivered via a peer-to-peer network are complete and undamaged. Merkle root is essential for the computation to keep the cryptocurrency running. However, the system can synchronize the previous data and permission of only one Merkle root per block. Example of Merkle Hash Tree Functions A Merkle hash tree function converts any length of random data to a fixed-size output. As it is a cryptographic function, it is applicable in cryptography. Merkle hashing is efficient and well-known for one feature: irreversibility. Merkle hashing is a one-way function that only works in one direction. Some types of hash families available are Message Direct, Secure Hash Function, and RIPE Message Digest. Let us use the following output: fbffd63a60374a31aa9811cbc80b577e23925a5874e86a17f712bab874f33ac9 Merkle Tree: The Merkle tree enables the user to determine whether or not there is a transaction in the block. When all the transactions in a block are verified and added, the system creates a digital fingerprint of the operations. The system generates a Merkle tree when only one hash of the Merkle Root (also known as the Root Hash) remains after repeatedly hashing pairs of nodes. Each leaf node is a hash of transactional data, while each non-leaf node is a hash of its previous hash. The system creates a separate hash for Each transaction in a block using cryptographic hash algorithms such as SHA-256. In a hierarchy, hash functions generate hashes of previously hashed transactions. The system reaches a Root Hash or Merkle Root with a repeat process. By merging all transactions in a block, a Merkle tree generates a digital fingerprint of the entire collection of activities. It allows the network user to determine whether the block included the transaction. The Merkle root ensures data block confidentiality, integrity, and consistency transmitted through a peer-to-peer network. It is a method for providing that each transaction is added to and confirmed in the Merkle tree. A Merkle Tree is far more complex than that (especially when each transaction ID is 64 characters long). The preceding illustration, on the other hand, clearly demonstrates how the algorithms work and why they are so successful. Merkle Tree Benefits in Blockchain Blockchains require Merkel Trees to run effectively and maintain transaction integrity. As the popularity of cryptocurrencies grows, it is critical to understand the role Merkle trees play to grasp the core concepts involved. Merkle trees provide the following significant advantages: Check the data’s accuracy: This method validates the data’s accuracy. Compared with other data structures, the Merkle tree data structure takes up very little disc space, and that system can split into tiny data bits for network verification. A comprehensive examination: The data format is efficient and takes little time to validate. Why Is the Merkle Tree Important in Blockchain? Because using Merkle trees in Blockchain is important and straightforward to grasp, it will be the significant example used in this section. In the absence of the Merkle tree, for example, each node will be required to maintain transaction copies that occurred in the Blockchain network. The amount of data present would be unfathomable. A node would need to connect to the network and seek copies of the ledger from its peers to confirm a previous transaction. The node must check each entry line by line to ensure its own and network records are identical. If there are differences between the ledgers, the network’s security may be jeopardized. Because you need the real data to confirm it, every Blockchain verification request necessitates sending outrageously enormous packets over the network. The computer used for validating would require a lot of processing power to compare the ledgers to verify for changes. Merkle trees offer a solution to this problem. By hashing accounting records, they separate the data from the data’s evidence. They can: Show that a transaction can be valid with only a small amount of data transferred across the network. Demonstrate that both ledger types consume the same amount of notional processing power and network bandwidth. Conclusion: Most likely, Blockchain and cryptocurrencies would not have existed if Merkle trees had not been created. The computer power and storage amount would be too expensive to operate without a workable alternative. The fact that a comparatively old concept is applicable in contemporary technology is fascinating. It is one of the primary causes for why this technology can function effectively in the first place. The Merkle tree is a key foundational component of blockchain technology that supports its development in the IT industry. Follow us on our LinkedIn Page for more exciting updates.

"What is Retail and Wholesale CBDC? It’s Importance.","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-retail-and-wholesale-cbdc-its-importance/","Blog Post","02/12/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","CBDC, or Central Bank Digital Currency, has recently made news in the world of banking and economics. This digital form of currency is produced and supported by central banks, and it has the potential to revolutionize the way we conduct financial transactions, store value, and execute transactions. Recently, in India, RBI has launched CBDC pilot project. But what precisely is CBDC, and what does it represent for money’s future? This blog post will define CBDC and discuss its types like Retail CBDC and Wholesale CBDC. And how is the digital Rupee different from the money in our bank account? Aren’t they the same thing? Table of Contents • CBDC Meaning • Wholesale Digital Rupee (e₹-W) • Five things to know about the rollout of the Retail Digital Rupee Pilot CBDC Meaning CBDC is an abbreviation for Central Bank Digital Currency. It is a digital fiat currency issued and guaranteed by a central bank. CBDCs are intended to act as digital counterparts of physical currency, facilitating secure, convenient, and quick payment and settlement. CBDCs have various applications, including retail and wholesale payments, cross-border transactions, and financial inclusion efforts. Many central banks worldwide are now investigating the development and deployment of CBDCs. CBDC RBI First, the digital Rupee (e) or CBDC RBI is a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), a digital form of legal currency that a central bank issues. It’s the same as a fiat currency and can be exchanged for it one-for-one. In simple terms, it is a legal way to pay off debts or meet other financial obligations in India. Bitcoin, Dogecoin, or any other cryptocurrency cannot be used as a means of exchange. This factor makes a CBDC different from other digital currencies. Is it different from the money in the bank? The number we see when we log into banking? Well, that number isn’t legal money. It’s more of a promise from the bank to you, the customer, that when you ask for your money, the bank will give you that amount. It shows up as a debt on the bank’s balance sheet. You can get your funds back if the bank gets into trouble and stops working. In other words, there is a risk of credit and liquidity with that money, and payments made with it still need intermediaries, like other banks! CBDC is a liability on the central bank’s balance sheet, which is why it is called “central bank digital currency.” There is no credit risk or liquidity risk. CBDC doesn’t need intermediaries to settle a case (for the wholesale version). So the matter is resolved right away and for good. Just like when we exchange cash from one person to another, we don’t need an intermediary and don’t have a transaction delay for someone else to confirm the transaction. Need for the retail and wholesale versions of the Digital Rupee Retail Digital Rupee (e₹-R) e-R is an electronic version of cash that can be used in stores. It can be used by any private sector or business, which means people like you and me can use it. We already have a lot of different products, like RTGS, NEFT, IMPS, and UPI. e-R gives us direct access to the RBI’s money for payments and settlements, which helps our payment systems work better. It can be used as a backup to make digital payments if there are problems with how the current payment rails work or how they are set up. One more reason for e-R is that it helps people get into the financial system. Wholesale Digital Rupee (e₹-W) e₹-W is made so that only financial institutions can use it. It should make payments and settlements between banks run more smoothly. We can use this version of the Rupee in transactions like banks trading in government bonds, inter-bank markets, managing collateral and liquidity with central banks, etc. Also, e-W can make money from central banks programmable, help automate processes, and reduce risks. Lastly, this is on the most recent technology stack. With a clean slate, RBI could design it to work with the currencies of other central banks. Does that mean banks won't exist anymore? No. There are two design options to consider when it comes to giving out and keeping track of CBDC. These are all about the CBDC: In this model, RBI is in charge of giving out money, checking transactions, and keeping records. RBI will have to keep a book and keep it up to date. The central bank will also have to deal with things like KYC/AML, onboarding customers, etc. This step will put massive pressure on the central bank and stop private banks from participating in the economy. These banks have already made great systems for bringing new customers on board and giving them payment services. Because of this, the digital Rupee is made to be an Indirect CBDC. Indirect CBDC: In this model, people will store their e-Rupee in a wallet that banks and service providers will give them. So the RBI will give the CBDC to “Token Service Providers” (TSP), who will then provide it to end consumers. RBI will keep track of the wholesale CBDC balances of the banks, and the intermediaries will continue to give out tokens when customers ask to make a transaction. So, both the RBI and the banks can do what they do best. The banks will offer onboarding, Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering (KYC/AML), and payment services, and the central bank will continue to keep an eye on the rules. Five things to know about the rollout of the Retail Digital Rupee Pilot The pilot covers certain places in closed user groups (CUG) where merchants and customers of participating banks have already been identified. Users can buy and sell e-R through a digital wallet on mobile phones or other devices. Both Person to Merchant (P2M) and Person to Person (P2P) transactions are possible. QR codes, displayed at merchant’s locations, can be used to make payments. The e-R has some of the same qualities as physical cash, such as trust, safety, and a final settlement. Like cash, it doesn’t earn interest and can be changed into other kinds of money, like bank deposits. The pilot will test how well the process of making, distributing and using digital rupees at retail stores works. For more updates, stay tuned with Blockchain Shiksha.

"What is Proof of Reserves (POR) in Blockchain Technology?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-proof-of-reserves-in-blockchain-technology/","Blog Post","30/11/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Proof of Reserve (PoR) is a familiar idea in the blockchain business. It is a way to prove to another party that it has enough assets. This idea started as a way for centralized digital asset exchanges and custodians (collectively called “digital asset platforms”) to show their customers that they had enough tokens to cover their debts. Overall, proving reserves is a way for an organization to show that it is trustworthy regarding holdings of digital assets in custody. Table of Contents • Proof of Reserve shows financial position • Why does it matter? Proof of Reserve shows financial position to following: A specific customer or the market as a whole Current or potential partners, regulators The management of the digital asset platform or any combination of the above. Proof of Reserve uses cryptography to increase transparency and trust signals when a user, customer, or counter party depends on another party to hold digital assets on their behalf. But there has yet to be a clear definition of what it means to do a Proof of Reserve. Why does it matter? Proof of Reserve is an integral part of the digital system for the participants and the people who use it. Due to the availability of clearly defined standards and benchmarks for verifying digital assets, proof of reserves gives users Transparency Improved risk assessment Eliminate bad actors How that digital asset can self-regulate and Deal with systemic risks that could stop more people from using digital assets and making new ones. In the last few years, regulators worldwide have been trying hard to develop policies encouraging innovation and protecting the market and investors. There is much room for change in public blockchains, which makes it hard to understand and improve the way rules are made. But it also allows us to use technology to change the current practices for risk management, auditing, and monitoring regulations. Trust and openness for customers, markets, and the government make it essential to have proof of reserve. After Satoshi Nakamoto’s much-talked-about white paper for Bitcoin came out, the total market capitalization of digital assets and the total number of tokens in circulation have grown significantly. One thing that policymakers worldwide agree on is that a lack of transparency makes it harder to invest and develop new ideas. People talk about how auditable and clear digital assets are. These public blockchains offer transparency that changes how things are done, but the databases of centralized parties make transfers and balances more difficult. More and more people think it’s important to check that a central authority should control the assets in reserve. Some examples of this are: The Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC): issued guidance for national banks that provide cryptocurrency custody services and payment activities. The European Central Bank (ECB) issued a white paper that tried to address regulating and overseeing stablecoins and assessing reserves and stablecoins in the following situations: a)A different way to store value, b) as a function of a digital asset, c) As a new way to pay. The above were all ways that regulators tried to apply regulatory standards and address measures of financial stability. Auditability: Blockchain technology aims to provide trust and audibility that can’t be changed and aren’t centralized. However, one problem with digital asset platforms is that most transactions and account balances are not linked to public blockchains because these platforms are centralized. Instead, a private database of centralized service providers maintains and controls the data (off-chain transactions). Co-mingled wallets are something that digital asset platforms do most of the time ( i.e., Omnibus wallets). These wallets are not open to the public and can’t be checked. So, the idea of a public, auditable ledger and transaction data can be complicated because digital asset platforms often use co-mingled wallets and off-chain transactions. Fraud Deterrence: If the Proof of Reserve is standardized and made public, it could stop people from holding partial reserves or not saying when they’ve lost reserves, and it could also make things more transparent. Also, hackers often go after digital asset platforms and custodians, just like they do with centralized platforms. Having a uniform and standard audit practice across the industry helps stop this kind of loss of reserves and shows it with a fair amount of certainty. Safety for the customer: Here, we use the United States as an example. They have a licensing system for transmitters spread out across the states. It has detailed rules to protect consumers. Many services are usually required to take specific steps to protect their customers by state regulators (MSB). This requirement includes, but is not limited to, keeping a certain amount of capital on hand and getting audited financial statements every year. In this way, for example, New York had double protection. It has a law about getting a license to send money and a law about doing business with virtual currency. This step ensures that service providers who do business with virtual currencies meet the requirements for money transmitters. Conclusion: Conversations and talks about PoR are changing, and the gaps in the market caused by the lack of a standard set of rules will have to be filled sooner or later. Centralization has already started in the blockchain space, with stablecoins, digital currencies from central banks, and financial institutions offering cryptocurrency-related products and services. But centralization and rules can also make things more difficult in the future. In the end, the market needs information that is clear and consistent.

"What is a Smart Contract in Blockchain Tech?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-an-smart-contract/","Blog Post","20/11/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","NFTs are handled via smart contracts and exist on the blockchain, in case you didn’t know. While buying or selling NFTs, it plays a crucial role. Learn more about this trustworthy software solution and how it may assist in proving ownership, combating counterfeiting, and more. Table of Contents • Smart Contract Meaning • The Benefits of Using Smart Contracts • Use Cases • Final Thoughts Smart Contract Meaning NFTs are handled via smart contracts and exist on the blockchain, in case you didn’t know. While buying or selling NFTs, smart contracts play a crucial role. Learn more about this trustworthy software solution and how it may assist in proving ownership, combating counterfeiting, and more. Smart contracts are programs recorded on a blockchain that automatically executes particular actions when criteria are satisfied. In a decentralized system, two parties can interact using a smart contract to replace the intermediary traditionally required to conduct transactions. It has been utilized in blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum to expedite transactions and automate procedures. What distinguishes smart contracts from others? These pieces of code automate processes and eliminate human errors, decreasing the time and expenses involved with typical agreements. Aside from reducing human errors, these contracts further benefit the blockchain business. What is Smart Contracts Audit? A smart contract audit is reviewing and analyzing a smart contract’s code to find and fix any bugs or flaws that could affect how it works, how secure it is, or how well it works. A team of experts does the audit. They use specialized tools and methods to test the contract code and ensure it meets the standards and specs set. This contract audit aims to lower the chance of a smart contract failing, make the contract more reliable, and increase user trust and confidence in the system. The Benefits of Using Smart Contracts A smart contract is a program that uses a dedicated virtual machine embedded in a blockchain or other distributed ledger to run business logic. 1: Business teams work with developers to decide how they want the smart contract to act when certain events or conditions happen. 2: Simple events include a payment approved, a shipment received, or a utility meter reading reaching a certain level. 3: More complex logic and complicated Operations go hand in hand like more complex logic, like figuring out the value of a derivative financial instrument or releasing an insurance payment automatically. 4: The developers then use a platform for writing smart contracts to make and test the logic. Security teams test the app after the development process. 5: An expert from inside the company performs double-checking of the app or a company that specializes in checking the security of these contracts. 6: An existing blockchain or distributed ledger infrastructure adopts the contract on approval. 7: On deploying the smart contract, it follows event updates from an “oracle,” a stream of cryptographically secure data. 8: The smart contract runs when it gets the right combination of events from one or more oracles. NFT Creation and Smart Contract While creating NFTs, the minting process is adopted, which entails transforming pictures, movies, sound snippets, and other digital media into cryptographic assets on a blockchain. When you mint NFTs, you are essentially customizing the underlying smart contract code that determines the attributes of your crypto assets. Several smart contract standards ensure NFTs can readily interface with applications. For example, TRON, EOS, and Tezos are smart contract blockchains featuring NFT creation tools. NFTs produced on multiple platforms may only be able to trade on the same NFT marketplaces once there is a clear standard for how smart contracts, and ultimately NFTs, should be constructed. Smart Contract Standards for NFT Since it was the first non-fungible token standard on Ethereum, the ERC-721 standard is one of the most frequently used in cryptocurrency. As a pioneer in the NFT minting arena, this standard is utilized by many to generate and launch NFTs. ERC-721 demands that all tokens be non-fungible and have unique token IDs, which other standards may not enforce. For the NFT gaming industry, apart from ERC-721, another protocol, the ERC-1155 standard, was designed to support fungible assets, such as in-game currency, and non-fungible assets, such as limited edition skins. Relation with Metaverse The metaverse is a three-dimensional digital environment that connects the financial, virtual, and physical worlds. The metaverse would include NFTs, blockchain games, and crypto as we know it. If these contracts are the cornerstone of NFTs, it’s no surprise they’re also essential in constructing the metaverse. NFT art and gaming, for example, are two potential features of the current metaverse ecosystem that smart contracts can support. Smart contracts can also ease monetary transactions, eliminating the requirement for a third party and lowering the friction of interactions on the metaverse. Use Cases: Enforcing Ownership and Authentication Data authentication and ownership enforcement are two benefits of using smart contracts to create NFTs. Everyone can access ownership and creation time information if these NFTs are available on public blockchains. In the case of digital degrees, educational institutions can award students with unique NFTs on public blockchains. Employers wishing to hire students can validate an applicant’s degree by searching for the applicable block explorer. Anyone can use this search engine to access public information stored on the blockchain. Users can use this feature for NFT licensing as well. It is simple to create details of transferred rights for a sound or image file and transfer them to the subsequent NFT token holder. Preventing plagiarism and forgery Smart contracts using NFTs can also aid in the fight against counterfeiting and plagiarism. Smart contracts using blockchain tech may automatically examine the time and location of the creation of an NFT or token, i.e., the first recorded wallet address. Additionally, they can assist in combating fake certificates, tracing down the creative works’ owners, and stopping counterfeit goods sales. Such products, for example, can be automatically filtered out if they do not meet specific criteria. Making business interactions easier Smart contracts can improve business transactions in two ways: speed and security. It enables two parties to engage in a contract and guarantee the previously agreed-upon results once the conditions have been satisfied. Users can avoid delays caused by a lack of trust, resulting in a more efficient transaction process. Parties may not trust each other, but a smart contract that executes the transaction as soon as the contract terms are satisfied might comfort them. Consider the home-buying process. When the buyer has completed all the prerequisites, such as passing credit checks and making a successful down payment, the smart contract can deliver payments to the seller while transferring ownership to the buyer. Final Thoughts: Smart contracts are highly adaptable, and the users can tailor the terms and conditions to any sector’s requirements. As the foundation for one of the most exciting digital asset classes, these contracts will likely grow in importance as NFT adoption, and the metaverse expand. Follow us on LinkedIn. Thank You!

"Why Zero Knowledge Proof in Blockchain is Significant?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/zero-knowledge-proof-in-blockchain/","Blog Post","12/10/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","While the blockchain has provided several benefits in achieving the trilemma of scalability, decentralization, and security, it still cannot offer the privacy required for certain transactions. Combining blockchain technology with zero-knowledge proofs allows for the solution of privacy and scalability issues. ZKP and blockchain offer users an effective combination of security and immutability. Let’s review the fundamentals of zero-knowledge proof and how it powers blockchain technology. Table of Contents • What is Zero-Knowledge Proof in Blockchain Tech? • Properties of ZKPs • What are the two main types of Zero-Knowledge Proof? • Algorithms zk-SNARKs work on • What are some different ways Zero-Knowledge Proof can be used on the blockchain? • Advantages of Zero-Knowledge Proof • Applications of ZKP • Final Thoughts What is Zero-Knowledge Proof in Blockchain Tech? Zero-knowledge proof is an encryption scheme or protocol in which a prover can prove their case of truth concerning specific data to a verifier without revealing the entire secret information. As the information can be verified using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), this method secures and protects your private chats and transactions without disclosing the information to anyone who is not having valid authentication with the network. In the coming days, ZKPs have the potential to revolutionize how data is collected, utilized, and traded. A blockchain is a chain of immutable records that many parties manage, each with a list copy. Blockchains do not provide privacy or anonymity because all participants can see all transactions. Zero-knowledge proofs provide a way to verify that a transaction was successful without revealing the secret information used. This strategy allows for posting private transactions to the blockchain while maintaining privacy. ZKPs generally allow one party to demonstrate that they know a given value without providing additional information. In the blockchain world, zero-knowledge proof solves fundamental security and privacy problem. Multinational corporations use it to maintain confidentiality and facilitate transactions over a secure blockchain network. A specific (single and designated) node on the blockchain network executes the off-chain application code. The blockchain confirms its proper execution to other parties to verify its accuracy. The zero-knowledge proof allows users to send private messages without revealing their identity to the server. Unlike traditional messaging applications, software based on the ZKP protocol enables users to keep their personal information private, with only necessary data shared with the other party. The two main types of zero-knowledge proofs are interactive and non-interactive. In interactive ZKPs, the prover must carry out tasks or actions to convince the Verifier that they have specific knowledge. Most of the activities required in interactive ZKPs use mathematical probability principles. Non-interactive ZKPs do not require interaction between the prover and the Verifier and offer the option to complete the verification process later. These ZKPs require the use of additional computers or software. Users can securely communicate complex documents by integrating ZKPs with blockchain. The fact that they can encrypt data in chunks allows users to control the availability of specific blocks and the information contained within them, allowing certain users access while restricting others. Properties of ZKPs: 1. Completeness The completeness property refers that the transaction has been checked and that the prover can proceed. When the transaction statement is true, the Verifier can give the prover the input he requested. 2. Soundness The soundness property refers to the authentic transaction, not part of a fraud case. The Verifier can only be persuaded if the marketing is different and the statement is correct. In this case, the Verifier can’t vouch for the prover or let the prover get the inputs. 3. Zero-knowledge The Verifier knows nothing but the current statement and whether it’s true or false. Any additional information and private information about different parties are kept secret. At the highest level, a Zero-Knowledge Proof is made by the Verifier asking the prover questions to answer correctly if the prover knows all the needed information. More likely than not, the Verifier’s test will eventually show that the prover was wrong. What are the two main types of Zero-Knowledge Proof? There are two basic kinds of ZKPs, which are: Interactive ZKP: The actions that go with the ideas have to do with probability in math. In interactive ZKP, a prover has to persuade a specific verifier and then do the same thing for each Verifier. In interactive ZKPs, the person trying to prove a fact must do a series of things to convince the person to check the validity. Non-Interactive ZKP: Non-interactive ZKPs don’t allow the Verifier and the Prover to talk to each other. In non-interactive ZKP, a prover makes proof that anyone can check. The system can postpone the process of reviewing the proof later. For non-interactive ZKPs to work better, they need specific software. Let’s discuss what ZKP means and the use cases of this technology. Zcash is a well-known use of Zero-Knowledge proof. Zcash was the first to use zk-SNARKs, the primary type of Zero-Knowledge cryptography. Now we have to figure out what zk-SNARKs are. Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge is the full name for zk-SNARKs. zk-SNARKs is a technology that uses ZKP that doesn’t need to be discussed. Algorithms zk-SNARKs work on The Key Generator A key generator sets a parameter to make a key pair. A trusted source can delete the private information after making a private or public key pair. Another pair of keys use public information. One of these would be used to prove something, and the other keys are applied to check something else. Prover The prover gets the proving key and has to show how well he knows something. He will get the private key and check it. After that, he will send the statement. Verifier The prover will give the verifier information, and the Verifier will check that the statement is true. The following four things must also be true of Zk-SNARKS. The person who checks the statement will only find out what is necessary. If a challenge needs to be short, it should take at least a few milliseconds. The process should not involve any interaction. The proof should be based on the soundness principle and use zero-knowledge encryption. Prover and Verifier can only move forward with a reliable witness. What are some different ways Zero-Knowledge Proof can be used on the blockchain? 1. The blockchain has messengers. 2. Even though most of the messengers we use claim today to be encrypted, unencrypted blockchain could be the next big thing in technology. 3. With the promise of a strong but unencrypted solution, ZKPs and blockchain can work together to make a secure messaging platform with added value for everyone. 4. Next-gen file system controls ZKPs add more security layers to files and logins. So, ZKPs can make it hard for hackers or people with bad intentions to change and get the data. Keeping things safe The information in a ZKP storage unit protects a security protocol that is part of the ZKP. The access channels have strong security measures that make the environment safe and easy to use. Getting private blockchain transactions to other people The biggest worry about private blockchain transactions is that traditional methods have a lot of holes. When ZKP and private blockchain transactions work well together, they can make a robust process that hackers can’t break. Advantages of Zero-Knowledge Proof Simplicity: ZKPs are best known for their simplicity. You don’t need to know anything about software to use it, but it can offer better solutions that affect our daily lives. Also, because it is completely unencrypted but still very safe, it can give you the best of both worlds. Secure: When it comes to sharing information, ZKPs is very safe. So, a user can use it confidently and not have to be an expert in codes or analytics to figure out how it works. Time saver: ZKPs cut down on the time needed for blockchain transactions, which is suitable for users. Privacy: The most liked thing about ZKPs is that it protects their users’ privacy. It never needs to share sensitive information, so it is always very private. Safety: Users of ZKPs know that ZKPs need to share data, and they can avoid any company that wants access to their personal information for no good reason. Data Safety: Banks and hospitals with access to sensitive information must ensure that no one else can see it. Together, ZKPs and blockchain can make it impossible to get to data. Applications of ZKP: Faceless Verifiable Voting Establishing explicit governance norms for distributed ledger technologies has always been difficult. Anonymous and verifiable voting is critical for ensuring adequate on-chain governance arrangements. Voting is fundamental to any democracy, from national to corporate shareholder engagement. As a result, as governments move toward digitization and security tokens proliferate, the demand for secure and faceless voting solutions is sure to rise. This increase in demand is due to how ZKPs handle anonymous verifiable voting. A responsible third party can no longer verify the outcomes because the public blockchain records votes. Furthermore, this system eliminates any chance of censorship. Eligible voters can use ZKPs to establish their voting eligibility without revealing their identity, making the voting mechanism anonymous. Furthermore, ZKPs allow voters to obtain verifiable assurance from the institution reporting the results that their vote was counted in the final total. This procedure makes the electoral body’s vote results auditable, even if the votes are not viewable on a public blockchain. Private Exchange and Settlement of Digital Assets Although one of the crucial that made the public blockchain trustworthily was its transparency, it has a lot of disadvantages. While some data should be available for public verification, a significant amount must be kept private. A privacy layer is required to ensure that the transaction amount and the participants in each transaction stay private. ZKPs alleviate this problem. The system readily prevents problems like order front-running when relevant transaction information is hidden. Furthermore, the system provides this functionality if auditing specific orders are ever required. In terms of asset settlement, for example, the system validates the best execution of an order without revealing the entire order book. Because the verification process is automated, this provides for a more efficient audit method. This process will also reduce the likelihood of disagreements between counterparties. It also enables the exchange operator to keep critical information private if necessary. This technology applies to both centralized and decentralized exchanges. This step is significant now, as several exchanges create blockchain-based decentralized alternatives. If they incorporate ZKP technology into these decentralized exchanges (DEXs), they can further reassure their clientele and their demand for anonymity. Privacy of Public Blockchains Public blockchain systems such as Ethereum, Cardano, and Tezos are already highly advanced. However, the system should ensure data privacy to utilize its potential fully. No company that values data privacy will use an entirely transparent blockchain. For example, companies that utilize the blockchain to trace their supply chain would prefer to keep their crucial supplier information private. As a result, they can introduce particular privacy layers. This strategy applies to private enterprise blockchains. ZKPs can provide this crucial privacy. Now, blockchains started adopting ZKPs in the context of blockchains. These are zk-SNARKS integrated into the protocols of several blockchains. Zcash, Horizen, and Komodo are examples of them. They can not only serve to protect information on a public blockchain, but they can also aid in alleviating scaling issues. Watching which protocol(s) will be at the forefront of ZKP research and implementation in the future will be fascinating. Some procedures already build the basis by teaming with industry professionals or sponsoring research institutions. Zcash, for example, is in the process of releasing new improvements to its ZKP-based zk-SNARK protocol. This step is all part of their sapling improvement, which will considerably minimize the difficulty of building ZKPs. If the sapling improvement produces the desired effects, shielded Zcash transaction prices and times are anticipated to decrease. This step means that ZEC is becoming the digital equivalent of untraceable cold hard cash. Final Thoughts ZKPs is undeniably a game-changing piece of technology. Even though it might take a long time for its implementation in any real-world applications, their complexity is evident. However, recent data breaches and other privacy issues have increased demand for a new choice. We only learned ZKPs’ potency when privacy-conscious cryptocurrencies began employing them in their protocols. Follow us on LinkedIn Related","[Blockchain]","NULL"
"Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) in Blockchain","https://blockchainshiksha.com/byzantine-fault-tolerance/","Blog Post","28/09/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Blockchain technology is well-known for its capacity to deliver secure and transparent transactions. Byzantine Fault Tolerance is one of the most important things that make it safe (BFT). This blog post will discuss BFT, how it works, and what it means for the blockchain ecosystem. BFT is a way for a distributed system to work even if some nodes are broken or trying to harm others. Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper on peer-to-peer electronic payment networks in 2008 revolutionized the perspective of technology. Other than finance, blockchain technology has found other notable applications over the years. With a few exceptions, developers have designed blockchain solutions as decentralized. Different nodes in a distributed network maintain a digital ledger that keeps track of all network transactions. For transactions to be valid, all parties must agree on specific transactions, implying the requirement for consensus techniques such as Byzantine Fault Tolerance, or BFT. Although in various discussions, there is a reference to BFT, many people are unaware of its functions. Table of Contents • What is Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) Its Significance? • Why Is Byzantine Fault Tolerance in blockchain system necessary? • Features of BFT • What exactly is a Byzantine Node? • What is Practical BFT or pBFT? • Final Thoughts What is Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) Its Significance? The main components of distributed blockchain systems are consensus models. They are significant additions to the blockchain ecosystem because they provide a critical capability promised by blockchain technology. They essentially serve as the foundation for encouraging user involvement on a blockchain network in a trustless environment. Byzantine Fault in Practice Tolerance is a famous example of one of the most common and promising consensus methods. The appropriate integration of consensus methods into cryptocurrency platforms may result in the formation of various sorts of networks with remarkable potential. As a result, blockchain assists people and machines in reaching agreements without the requirement for trust. Consensus procedures define a set of norms that a network of humans and computers may easily trust. Byzantine Fault Tolerance is a notable intervention in the blockchain ecosystem that allows for the development of trustworthy blockchain rules and protocols. Why Is Byzantine Fault Tolerance in Blockchain System Necessary? Peers and nodes in Blockchain Ecosystem Blockchain systems operate as networks that grant all machines in the network equal access and rights. The nodes might communicate with one another immediately. So, what exactly is a node? Every computer connected to the blockchain network is a peer or node. In a fully decentralized system, no peer or node has more authority than other peers or nodes. As a result, a blockchain lacks coordinators, directors, or managers to enforce rules and determine and penalize inappropriate behavior. On the contrary, the system is predicated on all nodes adhering to comparable rules or protocols while agreeing. When looking for agreement among all nodes, you’ll come across the phrase “consensus,” which means “universal agreement.” Consensus is the most vital yet challenging task in a decentralized system with no authority. Most nodes must agree on the integrity or authenticity of information or transactions for the system or network to function correctly. Consensus should be performed on the blockchain network at regular intervals. Consensus procedures such as Byzantine Fault Tolerance are required to deal with the uncertainty of some nodes failing or misbehaving. Furthermore, some nodes may disagree with the agreement reached by others. As a result, it is critical to ensure that the system design can quickly overcome such weaknesses. Role of BFT in the Blockchain Tech? Consensus-building in a peer-to-peer network may be facilitated by unanimity among trustworthy and reliable nodes. A situation in which all nodes repeat an incoming message demonstrates the foundation of Byzantine Fault Tolerance. If a node repeats the incoming message, it implies that it has no problems or flaws. On the other hand, the network might quickly rule out the potential of Byzantine nodes if the recipients repeat the incoming message. Features of BFT: Decentralized control: Byzantine fault tolerance ensures that neither a single node nor a group of nodes can take control of the network. Robustness: the network can keep running despite problems or bad actors. Consensus mechanism: Byzantine fault tolerance uses a consensus mechanism to ensure that all nodes agree on how the network is doing. Fault detection: Nodes in the network can tell when another node is acting maliciously or has failed. Replication: Byzantine fault tolerance ensures that multiple copies of the blockchain are kept, making it less likely that data will be lost. Redundancy: The network can keep running even if a lot of its nodes aren’t available. Transparency: Byzantine fault tolerance ensures that all nodes can see the state of the network and check on it. Security: Byzantine fault tolerance gives a high-security level by ensuring that bad people can’t get into the network. Scalability: Byzantine fault tolerance lets the network grow as more nodes are added. Flexibility: Different consensus algorithms can be used with Byzantine fault tolerance, depending on the network’s needs. What exactly is a Byzantine Node? A Byzantine node is a traitor node that purposefully lies or misleads other nodes in the network. The byzantine node may potentially deceive or lie to the nodes involved in the consensus mechanism. A blockchain network that runs flawlessly would guarantee that Byzantine Fault Tolerance in the blockchain aids it in overcoming failures. Byzantine nodes or malevolent nodes can cause Byzantine failures. Users may encounter two types of Byzantine failures, the first entirely technical. A minor technical fault in the node could impair its operation and stop responding or working fully in certain situations. Arbitrary node failure is the second type of Byzantine failure. In the event of an arbitrary node failure, a node may exhibit the following characteristics: Failure to produce a result Providing responses that provide false results Answering requests with purposefully misleading results Giving precise results to various system components in response to a single query. Byzantine Fault Tolerance, or BFT, aids in effectively addressing all of these issues by decreasing the impact of malicious nodes. It can safeguard the networks from potential system failures and maintain optimal network operation. Essentially, it allows honest and malicious nodes to accomplish their respective tasks without interfering with network speed. Extensive research on the Byzantine General’s Problem and optimization using a diverse range of practical solutions over many years has resulted in various enhancements over the standard BFT. What is Practical BFT or pBFT? In 1999, Barbara Liskov and Miguel Castro published a research article titled “Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance,” introducing one of the most well-known BFT optimizations. The primary goal of the practical BFT was to correct the flaws in the original BFT consensus mechanism. The pBFT consensus technique seeks to achieve effective Byzantine state machine replication to accommodate Byzantine nodes or failures. The fundamental assumption behind the practical BFT mechanism is the existence of independent node failures. Practical BFT also presupposes that specific independent nodes are in charge of spreading altered messages. Final Thoughts: Finally, Byzantine Fault Tolerance plays an essential role in altering consensus techniques. Blockchain applications are gradually gaining traction in a variety of industries. However, numerous issues are appearing in modern blockchain networks. As a result, it is critical to consider BFT as a crucial tool for ensuring that the network generally operates in the face of hostile actors. Because blockchain is open and transparent, it can attract many unwanted participants looking to further their interests. As a result, a thorough understanding of consensus processes such as BFT and improvisations such as practical BFT is required. For more interesting stories, follow our LinkedIn Page: Thank You!

"What is Bitcoin and Ethereum? Difference between BTC and ETH","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-bitcoin-and-ethereum/","Blog Post","10/08/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Table of Contents • What is Bitcoin? • What is Ethereum? • Key Differences Between BTC And ETH Bitcoin and Ethereum are popular cryptocurrencies and have aided the sector’s growth. Everyone wants to take part in Ethereum Vs Bitcoin discussion. Here we will see the common features as well as differences between ETH and BTC. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be formed and is popularly considered digital gold or “gold 2.0,” whereas Ethereum is a global decentralized computer. Because of its durability and scarcity, Bitcoin is known as “digital gold.” Ethereum is the world’s decentralized computer. No central authority controls the Ethereum network, which also supports decentralized apps (DApps). Bitcoin and Ethereum have features in common like:- Its ability to be held in digital wallets Use of alphanumeric strings as addresses Trading on cryptocurrency exchanges. They are digital assets built on an accessible distributed ledger known as a blockchain. Bitcoin and Ethereum are “decentralized cryptocurrencies,” meaning they are neither issued nor regulated by central authorities or other financial institutions. As a substitute, they rely on computers running replicas of their networks, called nodes, to guarantee that each network user is aware of the latest developments. There are significant distinctions between the two cryptocurrencies. These distinctions distinguish them and have sparked different disputes in which some say BTC and ETH are rivals. Because they serve diverse goals, they may complement each other. For Ethereum blockchain-based apps, ETH is used. A safe vault asset’s value is stable or increasing during market downturns. What is Bitcoin? The first cryptocurrency that could operate without a central authority was Bitcoin. , The enigmatic founder Satoshi Nakamoto in January 2009 mined was mined The genesis block, the first data block on the blockchain. Since then, Bitcoin’s popularity has steadily increased. Bitcoin was developed as a peer-to-peer (P2P) electronic cash system so parties could perform decentralized transactions. Bitcoin was the first crypto based on the blockchain, decentralized ledger technology (DLT). Blockchain technology overcame the Byzantine Generals Problem, which outlines decentralized systems’ difficulties in deciding on a single truth. Bitcoin uses a blockchain and proof-of-work (Pow) to solve the Byzantine Generals Problem. A group of miners has resolved this issue, all playing the role of generals. Every node tries to validate transactions that are equivalent to messages made to generals. The Bitcoin blockchain is accessible to the public and contains the history of every transaction ever made while spreading among many nodes to avoid tampering. When a different version of the hash is identified, other network participants reject it, known as tampering. Cryptographic hashes track tampering, which are long strings of numbers that must be the same for each node. The Bitcoin network processes data sets and converts them into hashes using the SHA-256 hash function, which converts data into those long strings of numbers. When a valid hash is detected, it is broadcast to the network and stored in a new block. Bitcoin blockchain miners construct and broadcast these blocks via a PoW mechanism in which nodes use vast amounts of computational power to perform hashing operations. Network participants establish an agreement using proof of work. Bitcoin’s mining and consensus mechanisms ensure malevolent actors cannot change other users’ balances or spend their funds twice while keeping the network operational with little downtime. The popularity of Bitcoin is increasing over time as it is a tamper-proof cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin holders can trade it at any moment without the interference of intermediaries or central banks. While Bitcoin began as a medium of exchange, facilitating the purchase of products, investors are holding it as a store of value. What is Ethereum? Ethereum takes things further by using the blockchain to build a decentralized computer. In contrast, Bitcoin uses technology to conduct financial transactions. It permits nodes and messages to be attached to each transaction. Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source, distributed blockchain network. It uses its native coin, Ether (ETH), to conduct transactions and communicate with apps built on top of the Ethereum network. Smart contracts are a crucial part of decentralized applications or DApps that operate without the involvement of a central body. Solidity, Ethereum’s programming language, is used to create smart contracts that operate on the blockchain. Ethereum’s potential applications are many because of the usage of smart contracts. On the Ethereum network, new experiments with decentralized applications are going on that provide financial services and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) as examples of what smart contracts enable developers to create. Bitcoin is a medium of trade and a store of value, while Ether connects with Ethereum network applications. Users must pay fees in Ether for transactions, create smart contracts, and use DApps. Key Differences Between BTC And ETH Although Ethereum and Bitcoin use distributed ledger and encryption concepts, their technical implementations differ. For example, while Bitcoin stores value as a digital version of gold, Ether is used to fuel the Ethereum network and its applications. Both the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks create new tokens. Bitcoin uses the Omni layer, a platform for producing and currency trading on the Bitcoin network. Stablecoins have the Omni layer. For the creation of Ethereum tokens, many standards are followed, the most well-liked of which is ERC-20. The ERC-20 standard specifies a set of regulations for network tokens. The ERC-20 standard requires developers to implement various functionalities before issuing their tokens. These services include providing information about the overall quantity of the token and displaying account balances on user addresses. It also allows funds to transfer between addresses. Although bitcoin transactions are financial, users can attach notes and messages by encoding them into data fields. Ethereum transactions may include executable code to establish smart contracts, interact with existing smart contracts, or run self-executing smart contract apps. Public wallet addresses differ on both networks. Similar to an Internaional Bank Account Number (IBAN), a unique identifier used by financial institutions to determine which bank and country a client’s account is in. These wallet addresses are unique identifiers that enable users to receive funds. Addresses on Bitcoin may begin with a 1, a 3, or “bc1,” whereas addresses on Ethereum begin with “0x.” While Bitcoin and Ethereum have both relied on proof-of-work consensus, Ethereum is transitioning to a proof-of-stake consensus method. Proof-of-stake works based on a transaction validator’s stake in the network. Users stake their ETH to become validators, organizations that check transactions to ensure the network isn’t being tampered with. Instead of having miners with specialized processors, proof-of-stake consensus methods reduce the energy required to reach consensus by allocating mining power to the fraction of validators’ tokens. It is more effortless to become a validator in a proof-of-stake network. It has fewer entry barriers for validators and is more resistant to decentralization. On the Ethereum network, there are various tokenized versions of Bitcoin. Bitcoin backs these in a 1:1 ratio, meaning that one BTC in custody represents every Bitcoin ERC-20 token. Tokenized Bitcoin versions on Ethereum enable users to preserve their BTC while using decentralized applications. Token holders, for example, can lend their BTC to earn interest. Scalability difficulties plague both the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. While Bitcoin can average seven transactions per second, the Ethereum network can handle roughly 30 transactions per second. Visa handles approximately 1,700 transactions per second and claims to scale to 24,000. As the number of people using both blockchains rises over time, Bitcoin and Ethereum have reached their capacity limits and require solutions to handle more users. Both networks’ transaction costs increase when demand for block space exceeds capacity. BTC and ETH take different techniques to address scalability difficulties. Technical advancements like Segregated Witness (SegWit), “segregates” some data from the space available in each block broadcast to the network, have been introduced in Bitcoin. SegWit makes better use of the restricted 1 MB of space available in each Bitcoin block. Developers are working on a layer-two scaling solution known as the Lightning Network, which would add a transaction layer to the main blockchain. Transactions on the Lightning Network are rapid and have low fees since they route payment channels that users construct. The Lightning Network’s user-generated payment channels are pre-funded with BTC and may allow most transactions to migrate from the primary blockchain to this layer-two network. Proponents expect that the Lightning Network has ability of handling up to 15 million transactions per second. The transactions settled on the core Bitcoin blockchain were those that opened and closed Lightning Network payment channels. Ethereum is also developing scaling solutions that will work on both the core Ethereum network and layer-two networks. Sharding is Ethereum’s main bet for expanding its primary blockchain, and it will boost transaction speed and minimize network congestion by generating new blockchains known as “Shards”. The Lightning Network’s user-generated payment channels are pre-funded with BTC and may allow most transactions to migrate from the primary blockchain to this layer-two network. Proponents anticipate that the Lightning Network will be capable of handling up to 15 million transactions per second. Only those transactions settle on the core Bitcoin blockchain that has “opened and closed Lightning Network payment channels. This arrangement means the Bitcoin network settles the transactions. Ethereum is also developing scaling solutions that will work on both the core Ethereum network and layer-two networks. Sharding is Ethereum’s main bet for expanding its primary blockchain, and it will minimize network congestion while increasing transactions per second by generating new blockchains known as “shards.” Shared chains significantly reduce the Random-Access Memory (RAM) and storage requirements of every Ethereum blockchain device. It also helps spread the processing resources required to run Ethereum across 64 networks. Servers that aggregate several transactions before sending them directly to the Ethereum blockchain are the basis for layer-two scaling solutions on the Ethereum platform. How these transactions are grouped and broadcast to Ethereum varies significantly between implementations. Sidechains are another term for layer-two solutions for Ethereum. Sidechains are separate networks that exist in addition to the Ethereum network. They are interoperable thanks to protocols that let users transfer tokens from one network to another, enabling them to use ETH-based applications with lower transaction costs. Bitcoin and Ethereum use various scaling strategies to minimize network congestion and boost the number of transactions per second.

"What is the structure of Ethereum? Ultimate Guide for Beginners","https://blockchainshiksha.com/ethereum-layers-ultimate-guide/","Blog Post","01/08/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Ethereum is a platform that permits anyone to develop unstoppable, decentralized applications. This article provides an essential and non-technical overview of structure of Ethereum, logic, and inner mechanics, how price of Ether is calculated. If you’ve never heard of Ethereum or aren’t sure what Ethereum basics are, I strongly advise you to read “What is Ethereum?” before delving deeper and learning the structure of Ethereum. The Ethereum Price predictions can be seen at Coincodex We can visualize Ethereum as a stack of several layers constructed on each other. Table of Contents • Three layers of Ethereum • Ethereum hardware layer: Blockchain • Ethereum software layer: Solidity • Ethereum application layer: dApps Three layers of Ethereum The first and most foundational layer is a vast computer network that executes transactions and keeps a common database up to date over time (the Ethereum blockchain). The second layer is the software layer, which enables developers to run programs known as “smart contracts” on the Ethereum blockchain using the “Solidity” programming language. The third layer comprises applications that provide various services to Ethereum users (from governance to identity management). The platform’s distinguishing characteristic is that leveraging the Ethereum hardware and software layers makes these apps decentralized, lacks a single point of failure, and is thus “unstoppable.” You cannot turn them off. Ethereum hardware layer: Blockchain We know that servers worldwide store all the data on the web. Your computer (client) establishes a connection to these servers when you launch a browser and browse the internet, downloading the content you need. This client-server system for the internet has a few centralized repositories (servers) that would disseminate material to many consumers (clients). However, because we are all both makers and users of material, the internet today connects many clients to other clients (Web 2.0). Computers in a vast network can communicate with one another and send stuff from the computer that developed it to the computer that requested it. A peer-to-peer computer network called the Ethereum hardware layer computes transactions and maintains their order in a shared ledger. This approach enables developers to create a distributed database that can keep track of all the information shared in the network, including all transactions. We refer to each computer in the network as a “node.” It processes incoming transactions and groups them into blocks broadcast to the whole Ethereum network. Here, you can observe how the Ethereum computer network is now handling transactions. Transactions can include both money and information. The Ethereum platform’s digital currency is Ether, which shows its value. And the code has data that can be passed and start operations. This code is relevant for Ethereum’s software layer and hardware layer. Internet connects hundreds of computers across the globe. Anyone can offer their computer to handle network transactions simply by running some code on their laptop. An incentive plan supports the growth of the Ethereum network. Individual host nodes get “Ether” – a valuable asset that nodes can use to access the platform’s apps. This structure will give you a general grasp of the Ethereum hardware layer. To learn more about how these computers coordinate their work and process transactions, you should first understand the fundamentals of blockchain technology. Ethereum software layer: Solidity The Ethereum platform’s versatility drew early Bitcoin and blockchain adopters to it. Whereas Bitcoin is a currency for exchanging value between diverse players, the objective for Ethereum is to expand the usage of Bitcoin’s underlying technology and create a broader, general-purpose blockchain. The Ethereum software layer creates and facilitates the exchange of value in any shape or form, whether money, a house, an identity, the right to use or reproduce music, or any other asset you can conceive. A new programming language called “Solidity“ was developed to do this. It’s very comparable to JavaScript for those of you who are software engineers. Solidity allows programmers to create simple “smart contracts” programs that implement fundamental transaction logic. Ethereum also enables anybody to create new digital currencies (or “tokens”) that all Ethereum users may exchange. This feature permits various applications, from digitizing your favorite coffee shop’s reward points to establishing new economies in specific markets. The Ethereum code is open source, and developers can use it using Github.com. In addition, anyone can download and use the code to create a new application for free. Because Ethereum is open source, anyone who wants to contribute can create new code and post it publicly, adding new features or improving the whole platform by resolving flaws. This feature also implies that the Ethereum platform is self-evolving, as the community always adds new code, similar to how Wikipedia users add recent articles and change current ones. Anyone may learn to program in Solidity; there are numerous free resources online, such as the Ethereum official website or these gamified zombie classes. To summarize, the Ethereum software layer allows software developers to create smart contracts that would enable programmable value transfer. Because the code for all smart contracts is public, everyone can see what these programs genuinely do. Ethereum application layer: dApps The hardware, as mentioned earlier, and software layers enable Ethereum to function as a global, decentralized supercomputer on which users can run third-party applications. While many early users used Ethereum’s “token emission” function to obtain funds to establish new ventures (Initial Coin Offerings), the applications of Ethereum go far beyond the financial sector. On Ethereum, over 2900 applications have been built. Because of Ethereum’s open and transparent character, many developers from over the world came together to build a vast and robust community that is currently striving to expand the platform’s functions and applications. The development of public and decentralized applications has various advantages over private and centralized systems, including: Transparency: Anyone may read the code and ensure that the application delivers on its promises. All transactions are also public and trackable. Resilience: It is difficult to stop those applications once they operate on Ethereum. Better coding: Because the code is public and accessible to any hacker, defects must be corrected quickly and effectively, resulting in higher quality and more trustworthy code. In the following article of this series, we will see the difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin. © Blockchain Shiksha Follow Us on LinkedIn Thank You! Related","[Blockchain]","NULL"
"What is Ethereum its Use Cases and Future of Ethereum","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-ethereum-its-use-cases-and-future-of-ethereum/","Blog Post","25/07/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Ethereum is one of the most important and well-known names in the world of cryptocurrencies. In 2015, Ethereum quickly became the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, right behind Bitcoin. But Ethereum is more than just a digital currency; it is also a platform for building decentralized apps that use blockchain technology. You’ve come to the right place if you’re new to the world of cryptocurrencies and want to know what Ethereum is all about. In this blog, we’ll talk about Ethereum’s pros and cons, its past, and what it might mean for the future of money and technology. What is Ethereum? Ethereum is a giant, decentralized supercomputer that uses blockchain technology. Some crucial developments distinguish Ethereum as a one-of-a-kind project containing all the building blocks required to establish a new, better, more secure, privacy, and trust-oriented internet. What is an exciting factor in Ethereum? Let’s start with the truth that it is “decentralized.” A network of computers or nodes runs this global computer, whereas nodes are dispersed worldwide (more specifically, it runs on a blockchain). This situation means that no one can unplug and halt its operations. Anyone who wishes to run a network node from any computer connected to the internet can do so without seeking permission. Furthermore, because it is decentralized, it cannot be readily hacked because there is no single point of failure. Who controls it? So, who is in charge of Ethereum? The answer is no one owns it. No single entity governs it; instead, a community of software engineers administers who write code and run network nodes on their computers. Ethereum is a genuinely decentralized project constructed by crowdsourcing the work of many experienced computer programmers. The Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization, aiming to build a more globally accessible, free, and trustworthy Internet, coordinates efforts to improve Ethereum technology. It is an open project, and anyone can utilize this worldwide computer. Many people can use it as they choose, and anyone can read the code that the computer is executing or create new code that the computer will be able to achieve. This feature means you can run your programs on it and use applications created by others. The Ethereum code is open source, and users can access it at github.com/ethereum. Users can communicate with one another without the usage of an intermediary, eliminating the need for a third party. When you elect to interact with a third-party application built on Ethereum, you may read the code directly to ensure that the program performs what it says. No middlemen, no surprises. The Ethereum Code is irrevocable. Transactions, data kept, and programs written are all permanent. They cannot be modified once deployed on the global computer. This feature means that not only can you verify the code of any program and understand what it does, but you can also be confident that no one will be able to change it once you’ve validated it. The code that is already in use cannot be updated. This computer’s interactions are exceedingly secure. All transaction with the computer (whether it is deploying new code, engaging with current apps, or transferring value) is cryptographically signed, which means they cannot be altered or copied. You preserve your worth because you own your data. On Ethereum, users can choose which data to give and keep, giving them complete control over who can use their data and for what purposes. Users will also be able to keep (and profit from) any value their data may generate, similar to all the data they post on Facebook or Twitter, which is a goldmine for advertising. What are Ethereum use cases? Ethereum aspires to provide a platform on which anybody can build value and data exchange apps. Ethereum-based programs use smart contracts for building Dapps to carry out financial and informational transactions. Let us take an example. Imagine Mr.X has installed a solar system on his roof, and Mr. Y, his neighbour, wants to use it to charge his home appliances. But, the billed amount is much less, and they don’t want to transfer money in every instance. For a smooth and seamless payment, they can write a smart contract on Ethereum to check the energy used and multiply it with charges for electricity at per market prevailing rate. It will transfer the amount automatically to Mr. X’s account from Mr. Y’s account without the involvement of third-party or extra charges. Following are the widespread applications of Ethereum. Identity Management Each user on the Ethereum network digitally signs all of their interactions with smart contracts or other users, and identity can be associated with a user. User's all actions are linked to their identity. Peer Mountain and Hu-manity are two blockchain-based identity management projects. Transparency and Trust Smart contracts can take the place of (and be used to enforce) contracts between parties whenever an agreement utilizes the programming language. Smart contracts ensure transparency. For example, suppose you want to donate to a non-profit organization but want to ensure that the money is used to assist clean water initiatives in Africa. On Ethereum, you can create an application that tracks the real-time usage of your money. Governance Ethereum is an excellent platform for handling large-scale voting systems. As each user on the Ethereum ecosystem can connect and interact securely, this system helps construct voting systems for corporate governance, elections, decision-making, and consensus agreements. Copyright/Ownership Repository Ethereum blockchain permanently stores the data in a transaction sent across the Ethereum network. They are unchangeable, carry a time stamp indicating data when they were added, and cannot be withdrawn. For these reasons, you can register your intellectual property (IP) or the copyright for a song or book on the Ethereum blockchain with the confidence that no one can delete it and that you can always substantiate that you are the author or owner of such a work. How to Use Ethereum Network? The first step in using Ethereum is to create your own Ethereum wallet and purchase some Ether (ETH) to conduct your foremost transactions. You can do so through exchanges such as Coinbase. After completing your wallet, you can use Ethereum applications and move ether between accounts. In the following blog post, we will see how Ethereum works. For more interesting stories, follow us on LinkedIn. Viesearch – The Human-curated Search Engine Related","[Basics, Blockchain]","NULL"
"What is Blockchain Consensus in Blockchain?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-blockchain-consensus-in-blockchain/","Blog Post","06/07/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","The blockchain Consensus mechanism is the process through which the peers of a Blockchain network agree on the current state of the network’s data. Consensus algorithms establish reliability and confidence in the Blockchain network in this way. In this article, we will understand the concept of blockchain consensus mechanisms, types of consensus mechanisms, etc. Key Takeaways Consensus mechanisms (also known as consensus protocols or consensus algorithms) validate transactions and keep the underlying blockchain secure. There are numerous sorts of consensus methods, each with advantages and disadvantages. Two popular consensus procedures are proof of work (PoW) and proof of stake (PoS). Consensus mechanism in blockchain technology? Consensus mechanisms are the foundation of all cryptocurrency blockchains and are responsible for their security. Before delving into the various consensus algorithms, we must first define what it means for blockchains to reach consensus. A blockchain is a distributed, decentralized, and frequently public digital ledger that records transactions. Each of these transactions is stored as a ‘block’ of data that peer-to-peer computer networks must independently validate before being added to the chain. This approach secures the blockchain against fraudulent activity and addresses the double-spending problem. Blockchain networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum use consensus methods to ensure that all participants (‘nodes’) in a blockchain network agree on a single version of history (also known as consensus protocols or consensus algorithms). These mechanisms are designed to make the system more fault-tolerant. Consensus algorithms are methods for collective decision-making in which group members create and support the choice that will benefit the group. Regardless of whether they agree with the majority decision, it is a type of resolution that requires everyone to endorse. A consensus algorithm asks miners to solve challenging cryptographic mathematical riddles in exchange for a fixed quantity of cryptos, such as Bitcoins. It is critical to realize that each block contributed to the network must adhere to consensus rules. For example, Bitcoin’s consensus rules include no double spending, the right block format, a particular amount of compensation for miners, and so on. Blocks that do not adhere to these consensus guidelines will be discarded. A combination of PoW consensus algorithms and consensus rules provides a robust and dependable network that is safe and assures that all nodes in the network agree on a consistent global state of the blockchain. The consensus protocol’s primary purpose is to allow nodes to interact and give a shared set of verified transactions that may be put into the ledger. This process intends to stop dishonest miners from creating phony transactions and blocks. The network determines the sort of mechanism to be employed. Let’s go through a couple of the mechanics. Objectives of Consensus Mechanism Reaching an agreement: The method collects as much consent from the group. Collaboration: Each group strives towards a state of harmony that benefits the group. Cooperation: Everyone will work together, putting their interests aside. Equal Rights: Every participant has the same vote worth, implying that every person’s vote counts. Participation: The vote must be done by everyone in the network. No one may be excluded or continue to be without a vote. Every member of the group participates equally. No one in the organization has more responsibility. What is the role of the Consensus Mechanism in Blockchain? The biggest issue with Byzantine is reaching a consensus. Nodes cannot agree or have a higher difficulty score if even one error occurs. Consensus algorithms, on the other hand, can handle this sort of challenge. The primary purpose is to achieve a given goal by whatever means necessary. Blockchain consensus models are far more dependable and fault-tolerant than Byzantine ones. The Byzantine Fault Tolerance is a mechanism having a specific failure event. The problem is known as the Byzantine Generals’ problem. A distributed computer system is the most significant way to experience the issue. There are several situations in which consensus systems fail. Types of Consensus Mechanisms (1) Proof of Work consensus: PoW is now the most prevalent and one of the most robust blockchain consensus mechanisms. Before approving the new block to the ledger, the miner must solve mathematically challenging riddles on the new block. After completing the challenge, the solution is sent to other miners for validation before being included in their ledger copies. According to the PoW algorithm, nodes must adopt the fork that carries work, and it is improbable that two competing forks would create the next block together. With the adoption of proof-of-work (PoW), the blockchain network verifies each transaction and prevents double-spending. After verification, minors finalize and authorize transactions. If someone tries to replicate a transaction, the web will detect it as a forgery and will not be approved. Once a transaction is accepted, you cannot double-spend. How Does POW Work? First, the miners will solve all the problems, after which the ecosystem creates new blocks and confirm the transactions. It’s hard to predict how difficult a challenge will be. It significantly depends on the maximum number of users, the minimum current power, and the total network load. New blocks include a Hashing Algorithm, each consisting of the previous block’s hash function. As a result, the network provides an extra layer of security and prohibits any form of infringement. A new block is constructed, and the transaction is confirmed after a miner solves the riddle. (2) Delegated Proof-of-stake (DPoW) DPoS is not the same as PoS. Token holders do not work on the validity of the blocks directly but rather choose delegates to do so for them. A DPoS system typically has between 21 and 100 designated representatives. The delegates are regularly rotated and given the order to present their blocks. If you have fewer delegates, they may arrange themselves more effectively and generate time slots to publish blocks. If the representatives consistently miss their blocks or post erroneous transactions, the token holders vote them out and replace them with another chosen delegate. (3) Proof-of-stake consensus: PoS is a PoW alternative that requires fewer CPU calculations for mining. This feature is similar to an algorithm with the same goal as PoW, but the approach is somewhat distinguishable. A miner is paid for solving mathematical problems and producing new blocks in PoW. At the same time, the creator of a new partnership in Proof-of-Stake is also chosen deterministic based on its wealth, also known as stake. This step indicates that there is no block reward in the PoS process. As a result, the miners profit from the transaction fees. The PoS system has advantages and disadvantages, and the actual implementation is relatively complicated. How Does POS work? Minors are pre-selected in this consensus procedure. Even though the process is random, not every miner can participate in the staking. The network selects them randomly. You will be eligible to join the web as a node if you have a certain number of coins in your wallet. After becoming a node, you must deposit a particular quantity of coins to be eligible to become a miner. The system will then use a voting method to choose the validators. When everything is finished, the miners will stake the bare minimum for the unique wallet staking. In reality, the procedure is relatively straightforward. New blocks will be generated following the number of coins in the wallet. For example, if you possess 5% of all currencies, you can mine 5% of all new blocks. (4) Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) BFT is used to resolve the problem of a rogue or unreliable node. The blockchain’s dependability collapses if any community member distributes inaccurate information about transactions to others, and no centralized body can step in to repair it. To address this, PoW already provides BFT via its processing power. PoS, on the other hand, requires a more definitive answer. Nodes will regularly vote to determine the genuine transaction. Using a variant of PoS that works with BFT is the most viable solution to blockchain transaction approval. Also Read: Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) (blockchainshiksha.com) (5) Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) Hyperledger supports two consensus algorithms: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and SIEVE, which can handle non-deterministic chain code execution. PBFT was the first approach to establish consensus in the event of a Byzantine failure. The PBFT technique is also used by Stellar and Ripple. Each ‘generic’ in the PBFT process handles an internal state, a continuing information status. When a message is received, a general uses the message in conjunction with their internal state to initiate a computing process. This calculating procedure polls the broad public on their thoughts on the message. After making a decision, the general informs the other generals in the system. Based on the overall number of decisions made by all the generals, a consensus is reached. (6) SIEVE Hyperledger Fabric uses the SIEVE consensus method, enabling the network to detect and eliminate potentially non-deterministic requests while still achieving consensus on the output of recommended transactions. (7) Proof of Burn (PoB) Consensus To earn a proportional right to mine new blocks and verify transactions, miners purposely and permanently destroy or “burn” tokens under PoB. The more tokens a miner burns, the more likely the miner will be chosen as the next block validator. Miners in a PoB configuration can use significantly less energy than traditional PoW systems by demonstrating their loyalty to the network through intentional token destruction rather than using computing resources and leveraging sophisticated mining hardware. (8) Proof of Capacity (PoC) / Proof of Space (PoSpace) Proof of Capacity, also known as Proof of Capacity, decides mining rights and validates transactions using the available hard drive space in a miner’s device rather than using computational resources. Even before the mining activity begins, a list of potential cryptographic mining solutions is kept in the mining device’s hard drive, with larger hard drives capable of storing more potential solution values. As a result, the more a miner’s storage capacity, the more likely that miner will be able to match the required hash value of a new block production cycle and earn the mining reward. This protocol was created to circumvent the energy inefficiencies of traditional Proof of Work (PoW) mechanisms and the hoarding incentives introduced by many Proof of Stake (PoS) arrangements. (9) Evidence of Contribution (PoC/PoCo) Mechanism of Consensus Proof of Contribution (PoC) protocols use specialized algorithms to monitor the contributions of all active nodes in a network throughout each consensus round and then award the privilege to generate the following block to the node(s) with the highest contribution value. Under PoC, each executable action can be assigned a specific confidence threshold, which establishes the minimal amount of confidence required for the network to validate the calculation associated with that action. Users who want to do an on-chain computation within a PoC consensus mechanism must first stake a security deposit. Each user’s contribution level is determined by their past track record, stake amount, and the accuracy of their calculated result for every particular activity. For each consensus round, a series of eligible users suggest relevant computation results until a user successfully provides an impact with a confidence level that meets the required threshold. The nodes that compute the validated result will then be rewarded with the transaction fee from the user who requested the on-chain activity that just occurred, as well as the stake lost by users who calculated an incorrect result before the reputations of all involved users are readjusted. Almost always, many users will provide the same accurate result for any given computation. In these cases, the users’ confidence levels are combined to compute the result’s overall confidence score, and the consensus rewards are distributed among the users. While not widely utilized, Proof of Concept has been successfully applied in projects where the network must confirm on-chain operations performed off-chain securely and transparently. Bottom line: The consensus algorithms utilized by various blockchain platforms are motivated mainly by the applications the platform hopes to offer and the threats to the chain’s integrity. Permissionless systems attain consensus among many untrusted peers using computational difficulties. While approved blockchains use a less scalable but higher throughput approach that guarantees speedier transactions. Various factors are evaluated while selecting the best consensus model for a particular network, including the intended network, participant relationships, and functional and non-functional elements.

"What are Blockchain Nodes and their types?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-are-blockchain-nodes/","Blog Post","03/07/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Anyone who talks about the blockchain ecosystem refers to it as a shared, immutable ledger. But do you know who maintains this decentralized blockchain ecosystem and who shares this ledger? The answer is blockchain nodes. This article will discuss the critical concept of nodes in the blockchain ecosystem. What are Blockchain nodes? It is necessary to know what nodes are and why we need them. Let us take the example of cricket fans. They know the rules of playing cricket, and they have their favorite player team. They like to enjoy matches between their favorite teams. But what will happen if the cricket ground is not available to play? In the above example, we can compare the players with blockchain platforms. Teams are different blockchains like private, public, and hybrid blockchain platforms, and the critical factor playground is the nodes in the blockchain ecosystem. That means blockchain nodes or crypto nodes are necessary for the execution of the Blockchain. Why do we need Nodes? The main reason for developing a Blockchain application is to ensure data integrity and network credibility. These properties are maintained by sharing the same ledger across multiple distributed systems. The Blockchain concept states that every data-containing block is linked cryptographically to the next block. If you change or modify one block, all subsequent blocks change because their value or hash depends on the previous block. If all blocks are concentrated in one place, a hacker could alter the values of all the blocks in this cryptographic chain. Blockchain is a distributed network that shares identical copies of the ledger or data among multiple systems to ensure data integrity. Every Blockchain network requires globally distributed systems to be truly decentralized. If the ledger on one system is altered, the ledger on the other system serves as proof of data integrity. As a result, the availability of these systems, or Blockchain nodes, makes them distributed and trustworthy. Without nodes, a blockchain is nothing more than a database protected by cryptographic hashing. Whether the Blockchain is private or public, a globally distributed network is necessary for the persistence of the data. It stores the transactional record on the Blockchain nodes. The immutable record on nodes is the reason for Blockchain’s unquestionable auditability of data or transaction records. Additionally, the network can withstand centralized attacks and natural disasters by spreading out different crypto nodes globally. One Blockchain node must supply the Blockchain ledger to the network, even if an entire nation is destroyed for any reason. In the Blockchain network, nodes are electronic devices connected to the network with an IP address. In general, nodes serve as communication endpoints. Any user or application wishing to interact with the Blockchain must do so via nodes that act as a point of communication redistribution. It is a common misunderstanding that all nodes provide the same functionality and that all users engaging with the Blockchain are also considered nodes. There are two factors to consider here. For starters, only some devices connected to the Blockchain network are a node. Two, only some nodes on the Blockchain network perform the same functions. The requirements of a specific Blockchain network define the nodes’ various roles. The Corda Blockchain, for example, has two types of nodes: one for the client and one for the digital notary who validates transactions. Another notable example is the Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain Network, which requires multiple roles to provide a modular architecture. A node for a Membership Service Provider, Users, Endorsers, Anchors, and other entities are included. Since each node is responsible for carrying out a specific number of tasks, creating different roles enables the Blockchain to function efficiently. How does a blockchain node work? The primary roles of a blockchain node are broadcasting and validating transactions. When a user submits a transaction, it’s received by a node, which broadcasts it to the rest of the network. All the nodes in the network check the trade to ensure that the sender has the funds available and is authorized to send them. The fact that every node verifies transactions helps secure the network. An invalid transaction could only be approved if 51% of the nodes confirmed it. In blockchain networks with hundreds or thousands of nodes, it’s extremely unlikely that a bad actor can take over 51%. It’s always worth researching how a specific blockchain’s nodes work if you’re considering investing in a cryptocurrency to get a more accurate idea of its security. After the nodes validate new transactions, they’re grouped into blocks. Each new block is added to the Blockchain following the rules of its consensus mechanism, which are enforced by select nodes called full nodes. Blockchain Nodes and Miners To validate transactions, several blockchains, including Bitcoin, use cryptocurrency mining. There are blockchain nodes and miners in this system. A miner is a specialized node that confirms groups of transactions in exchange for cryptocurrency incentives. Nodes and miners manage different aspects of the transaction process. As previously mentioned, the process begins with nodes validating transactions. Miners compete against one another for the chance to confirm those transactions. The Blockchain’s consensus mechanism determines the method they use. Miners compete to be the first to solve a mathematical equation in the most systematic approach, known as proof of work. The winning miner assembles and confirms transactions into a block. The block is then broadcast to the network for evaluation by the nodes. Each node verifies that everything in the block is correct before adding the validated block to its Blockchain. Not every Blockchain employs or employs miners. Other consensus systems use various methods to determine who validates transactions. Proof of stake, for example, forces participants to lock up their cryptocurrency funds as collateral to participate in the process. Functions of Blockchain Nodes 1. Transaction Processing: Any transaction performed on the Blockchain is transmitted to nodes in the Blockchain network. Some nodes participate in the network’s consensus algorithm to validate the transaction, while others are only responsible for keeping the record. In this scenario, the node receives a transaction, accepts or rejects it, records the data, and returns it to the peers. The node may be required to share this data with other nodes and maintain synchronization. In this way, Blockchain keeps track of transactions. 2. Blockchain Accommodation: Nodes are responsible for the upkeep of the Blockchain and its expansion. Every new block of data added to the Blockchain is also part of the node’s storage. These nodes expand the Blockchain ecosystem, which then syncs to keep a single copy of the ledger. On the contrary, the consensus algorithm creates blocks and validates transactions. 3. Access: Nodes ensure users continue unrestricted access to the Blockchain ledger. You interact with a node when you visit a Blockchain explorer like Etherescan to view various Ethereum network transactions or get details on a transaction based on its transaction id. The block explorer is an interface that links to a node and regains data from it. As a result, nodes are responsible for ensuring access to the data stored on the Blockchain. Although there are various types of nodes in Blockchain, as was already mentioned in this article, this is predicated on the idea that the node is storing the data. Types of Blockchain Nodes 1. Full Nodes: When we search for something random on Google, the search results are returned from the nearest server that stores all that information. Similarly, full nodes maintain all transaction records in the Blockchain. They are Blockchain servers. Furthermore, full nodes are integral to the Blockchain’s governance model. Despite the possibility of various governance models, a Blockchain typically only experiences updates or improvements following the approval of most full nodes. As a result, full nodes have voting power on the Blockchain. It is critical to understand that there are times when many full nodes agree to certain Blockchain modifications but do not form a majority. For example, 55 percent of nodes may agree to a particular change, while 45 percent disagree. In such cases, a hard cryptocurrency fork is possible, which means the Blockchain is split in two. Both the new Blockchain and the old Blockchain will function as before with the addition of the changes that 55% of full nodes have suggested. Full Nodes are categorized into the following subtypes. Pruned Full Nodes: These nodes have a set amount of memory for storing data. There is no limit to the number of blocks we can add to Blockchain. But there is a restriction to the number of blocks a full node can store. Full nodes that have been pruned download the blocks to keep the Blockchain ledger up to date. When it reaches a certain threshold, it deletes the oldest blocks to make room for new blocks, thereby preserving blockchain size. The old blocks, however, are partially deleted because their essential metadata and sequence in the Blockchain are still present to maintain the fundamental principles of Blockchain. Archival Full Nodes: Blockchain’s most common full nodes. They keep the entire Blockchain in their database. The only significant difference between a full archival node and a pruned full node is the amount of memory available. Authority Nodes: Anyone with access to a public Blockchain can synchronize their system with the Blockchain data to join the network and become a node. However, there are many instances where data access must be maintained. In this case, the Blockchain must be governed by authorized entities. At this point, authority nodes come into play. The name of these nodes refers to the fact that they are in charge of or accountable for approving the entry of other nodes into the Blockchain network. Even defining other nodes’ access to a specific data channel is sometimes the responsibility of authority nodes in some Blockchain platforms. For example, the doorman service in Corda and the Membership Service Provider in Hyperledger Fabric will keep track of each node’s digital identity. Miner Nodes: Some consensus algorithms, such as Proof-of-Work, require nodes to solve complex mathematical functions to validate a network transaction. Such validation tasks necessitate a substantial amount of computational power and energy consumption. As a result, miner nodes are nodes explicitly created to carry out the mining process. Staking Nodes: Other nodes, like miner nodes, are responsible for validating a transaction on the network to maintain the consensus algorithm. These nodes must stake their funds in Proof-of-Stake, one of the most well-known algorithms, validate the transaction, and then receive payment for their efforts. Staking involves selecting a node based on predefined criteria such as coinage or network time. Once a transaction has been validated, the chosen node can receive a reward. Staking nodes are nodes that do not require a lot of computation power. 2. Light Nodes: Remember the example of a Google search in the full nodes? Your local server keeps only some of the information. This server stores only relevant information based on recent activities, allowing you to access data quickly. This server must retrieve data from the main server if you search for something new. A light node accomplishes this. A light node stores and provides only the data required to support daily activities or faster transactions. They do not validate the blocks and only store the Block headers. Simplified Payment Verification nodes are another name for these (SPV nodes). Conclusion: The role of nodes in a Blockchain network is similar to that of servers on the Internet. Understanding the concept of nodes is essential whether you are a student, a developer, a solutions architect, a researcher, a consultant, a business owner, or anyone else involved in the Blockchain world. For example, a business owner should understand Blockchain nodes because the cost and infrastructure for developing a Blockchain application depend heavily on the node requirement. Understanding Blockchain nodes enables blockchain architects to create the optimal solution by leveraging node availability, computational power, and more. Every Blockchain application is as dependent on Blockchain nodes as consensus algorithms or cryptographic techniques. In the following article, we will discuss what the consensus mechanism in the Blockchain is and what its variants are.

"How can Blockchain Tech Reform the Real Estate Industry?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/blockchain-in-real-estate/","Blog Post","28/06/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","After the adoption of Ethereum and Bitcoin on a global scale, the implementation of blockchain tech in real estate has become a reality. With the use of an advanced network of algorithms and computers, blockchain tech can disrupt the housing sector. This article will discuss the significance of blockchain in real estate and the impact of tokenization in real estate. Let us start. Significance of Blockchain in the Real Estate industry Blockchain real estate will operate as a more advanced and secure escrow company by utilizing a network of computers and nodes. Rather than exchanging closing documents for cash, users can extend blockchain real estate capabilities to almost every aspect of the industry. As a result, blockchain real estate may make it easier for participants in the real estate industry to exchange money, documents, contracts, and other kinds of information over a secure network. The popularity of blockchain in real estate is growing because it represents a significant change in the industry’s operations. All aspects of a transaction can now transition from the outdated procedures we use to online protocols with much more scalability, speed, optionality, and security, if for no other reason than the development of this technology. We can achieve many objectives like: 1. Fluidity in advance: Real estate transactions are fraught with challenges, not the least of which may threaten to derail a deal altogether. Of course, these barriers protect buyers and sellers from disastrous consequences, but they are still disruptive. The same safeguards designed to safeguard everyone can derail a transaction—blockchain in real estate improves the overall process by removing the most disruptive barriers that transaction participants face. The security protocols remove the obstacles causing disruption and improve fluidity, making the process more open to all parties. 2. Enhanced Transaction Speed: Once these blockchain real estate goals are met, more people will turn away from traditional processes and toward this technology. More volume will result from increased exposure and adoption. The time buyers and sellers can save using blockchain protocols will, at the very least, enable more transaction volume in a short amount of time. Shortening transaction times may accelerate the adoption of blockchain real estate technologies. 3. Smooth Information Distribution: Blockchain tech ensures the time distribution of information with all the parties to the transactions without the risk of being compromised. The information distributed is secured and verified, and corroborated. The buyers and sellers can access correct information more than any process we have today. 4. Secure capital transfer: With a blockchain ecosystem, users can transfer information and money from one party without putting issuers at risk. Security measures prioritizing authentication will ensure that money and information are safe and only available to those who need it. Impact of Blockchain on Asset Management and Real estate funds In real estate, tokenization means digitizing alternative assets, securities, and financial instruments. We can program digital assets to include transaction history, ownership rights, transfer and distribution compliance, asset issuance rules, etc. Tokenization enhances the speed of creating, exchanging, and issuing assets, reduces costs, innovates new features, manages corporate actions, and administers dividends. Comprehensive customization and quick issuance enable issuers to directly tailor digital assets to investor demands, drastically lowering counterparty risk. Reduced costs would allow issuers to reduce minimum investment amounts and reach a larger pool of investors. Final Thoughts: Blockchain, real estate applications, can change the housing industry’s perception. At the very least, groundbreaking technology’s applications have the potential to disrupt the entire real estate industry. Blockchain in real estate is the technology of the future, from more secure transactions to shorter closing windows, and one thing is sure: we are only getting started. Now is an excellent time to begin thinking about implementing your blockchain real estate applications and strategies. Those who jump on board with the trend early stand to gain significantly.

"Fractional NFTs Explained: How to Find the Best NFT Marketplace for Your Investments in 2023","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-fractional-nft/","Blog Post","07/06/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","A new investment option for NFT in the market is a Fractional NFT or Non-fungible token that gives ownership of digital assets. The popularity of NFTs is increasing as it ensures the advantages like decentralization and transparency. But, with the popularity of the NFTs, their prices have also increased, and most investors cannot afford them, which ultimately lead to the emergence of Fractional NFTs. Table of Contents • What is Fractional NFT? • Why are Fractional NFTs gaining popularity? • Top Fractional NFT Marketplace What is Fractional NFT? In fractional NFT, many owners own the NFT in the form of millions of fungible tokens. Vaults of decentralized tokens store these tokens. Asset fractionalization is common in traditional finance as it enables the investors to own expensive assets and share the associated risks and costs. This logic is also applicable to the NFT Factorization. A fractional NFT is a cluster of fungible tokens linked to a whole (for example, one Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT) or a group of NFTs like in the case of CryptoPunk NFTs. It implies fractional – or proportionally shared ownership of an NFT. At the time of fractionalization, the original NFT is kept in a vault, and a limited supply of fungible tokens representing ownership over that NFT is issued. Users can purchase these fungible tokens on fractional NFT platforms like fractional.art and trade on secondary markets like Uniswap. Why are Fractional NFTs gaining popularity? Non-Fungible Tokens have Ethereum blockchain ERC-721 protocol. Every NFT has immutable and unique smart contracts. The indivisibility of NFTs is a promising feature for tracing individuals’ intellectual property. Non-fungible assets experienced meteoric growth in 2021, with many million-dollar sales of NFT projects. Non-fungible tokens can be found anywhere, from virtual real estate, in-game collectibles, writer’s NFTs, digital art, and the metaverse. But, the unrealistic rise in the price of NFTs has made it beyond reach for average buyers. To resolve this concern, the concept of fractional NFTs emerged. Apart from removing entry barriers into the market, fractional NFTs generate liquidity in the market. These tokens create many other affordable tokens in the market for offering a share of renowned NFTs. Top Fractional NFT Marketplace Fractional.art: Fractional.art is a leading NFT marketplace and community for minting the NFTs using the fractional protocol. This decentralized platform is permissionless and governed by smart contracts. This condition means no one controls it but is available to everyone. PeckShield and Harchi Audit audit Fractional.art helps build trust on this platform. It has vaults for popular NFTs like Etherrock and Cryptopunks. This platform allows the seller to fractionalize NFT’s entire collection. This feature is mentioned as the NFT basket. This platform prevents unexpected NFT withdrawals as fractionalized NFTs can be withdrawn only in case when buyers purchase 100% tokens, or there is a buyout auction. Token holders have vote rights on the token’s reserve price after buying. Reserve price is the average of accumulated votes given by token holders. LIQNFT: LIQNFT has adopted fractionalized and serialized NFTs on the Solana blockchain. Serialization is not the same as fractionalization. With serialization, you gain full ownership of a limited-edition NFT print. This concept is similar to purchasing a limited luxury item. For example, the serial number is allocated to some cars, and the manufacturer produces only 50 of those cars. So you can buy 1 of 50 or 15 of 50. Pledging the NFT into a vault with serialization allows you to define parameters such as print supply, ownership price, etc. You must also pay a fee to pledge your NFT in the LIQNFT treasury. NFTfy.com: At NFTfy.com, fractionalize the trading F-Nfts in three steps. It allows the issuers to sell their fractions. This feature means that issuers can sell their tokens to any group of people even before fractionalization and vice versa. NFTfy charges 5% of the NFT’s final value for collective sale, which we think is reasonable. Your NFT is decentralized and secure, stacked into a small contract on the NFTfy platform. Unstacked NFTs can be unstacked by paying the reserve price or owing the full amount of the NFT. You can cancel or change your sale as a seller (NFT owner) before anyone buys your NFT fractions; you can no longer edit the sale once someone buys a fraction. So, ensure you have all the sale parameters and conditions before selling. NFtfy also allows you to fractionalize NFTs on Ethereum, Polygon, BNB, Avalanche, and Fantom blockchains. WithOtis: This platform for buying and selling collectibles, NFTs, and art shares. One of the primary benefits of using WithOtis for Fractionalized NFTs is the free mobile app on AppStore and the GooglePlay store. Otis holds the NFT assets in secure facilities. Aspen American Insurance Company covers these assets with insurance. Fees range from 5% to 15%. When you receive an offer, you will find a breakdown of the fees known as a sourcing fee. Otis currently has many blue-chip NFTs for fractionalization, including Pokeman Red, Cryptopunk #2142, #543, Grimes NFT collection, and other exciting collections. Maveron, Next View, and other similar ventures are among the major investors. Unicly: It is created by OxLeia, another trustworthy fractionalized NFT marketplace where you can buy and sell NFT fractions. Unicly works with both ERC-1155 and ERC-721 NFTs. At the moment, you can only buy and sell ETH NFTs. The buyer can specify the number of uTokens that can be voted on before they can unlock the collection. They can also decide the fractions of the NFT sold as uTokens. Once the collection is unlocked, you exchange your uTokens for ETH to purchase the NFTs. Unicly is more than just a marketplace for F-NFTs. They also offer swaps, farms, and various crypto tools. So, if you want to keep up with crypto projects and keep an eye on the F-NFT marketplace, this is your platform. Final Thoughts: Fractional NFTs are an intriguing solution for increasing the general public’s access to the world of NFTs. The most popular blue-chip NFTs on the market today are prohibitively expensive and out of reach for the average person. Fractionalized NFTs, on the other hand, can help you become the owner of a specific share of the NFT. Fractionalization opens up the possibility of using NFTs in various novel ways. For example, fractional tokens can be traded on secondary markets for interest, providing the opportunity for increased liquidity. For more updates, stay tuned. Team Blockchain Shiksha © Thank You!

"Why Hyperledger Fabric is the Best Choice for Healthcare Applications?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-hyperledger-2/","Blog Post","31/05/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Are you interested in Blockchain and its potential impact on healthcare applications? Hyperledger Fabric is the best choice for healthcare applications for multiple reasons. This article will discuss the reasons why Hyperledger Fabric is advisable. Blockchain has quickly gained popularity on the internet and in industries such as banking, healthcare, finance, and supply chain because it provides completely secure, dependable, and transparent transactions. Concerning the significant amount of sensitive data, the digitization rate in the healthcare industry is acting as a driving force. While evaluating the role of Blockchain in healthcare, it provides value more than just security and transparency. Blockchain ensures data integrity and data ownership with users rather than healthcare institutions. However, with so many Blockchain platforms on the market, a self-explanatory question arises: which blockchain-based ecosystem is the best option to support decentralized healthcare applications? Hyperledger has launched a blockchain-based platform to implement healthcare data management innovations! Healthcare applications built on Hyperledger Fabric have emerged as a widespread blockchain implementation. Before delving into Hyperledger healthcare applications, consider why Blockchain is required in the healthcare industry. Why is Blockchain Appropriate for the Healthcare industry? Throughout 2020 and 2021, everyone was overwhelmed by healthcare headlines. In the COVID-19 pandemic, millions have lost their lives, reflecting the statistics every nation’s administration preferred to represent. Even though the medical infrastructure dominated the headlines, the administrative authorities overlooked the importance of maintaining an authentic information infrastructure in the healthcare ecosystem. Existing healthcare data architecture is fragmented, with critical data spread across multiple systems and inaccessible to most people. Medical fraud includes falsifying reports and withholding crucial information from patients. Because the current database is stored in a physical system, anyone with access to it can change the data as needed. Healthcare providers lacked the patient’s data on a real-time basis due to the inconsistent and false data set. Blockchain technology is the foundation for a global electronic health record and offers natural solutions to these problems. It provides a secure digital environment for storing and authenticating patient information and public access to all healthcare information. Without a centralized authority, all users will control all transactions and information. Blockchain will provide the healthcare industry with security, scalability, and data privacy. The application of blockchain technology in healthcare is highly disruptive. This revolutionary journey would be implemented in stages, as it had previously been in Estonia. To begin with, Estonia successfully implemented blockchain technology to secure health data in 2012. As a result, by 2021, over 95% of the country’s healthcare information will be ledger-based. Benefits of Blockchain in Healthcare Applications 1. Data Security: The Blockchain’s secure network outperforms the traditional approach to securing health information. Once data is added to the Blockchain blocks, it cannot be changed or deleted. Even if the information needs to be updated, a new record with all previous entries is created. Furthermore, each record is accessible via a unique private key that the patient controls. Because a hash represents each document, verifying the modifications to the original hash ensures maximum transparency and verifiability. Another field where Blockchain is uniquely suited is health insurance claims. It accelerates processing times, minimizes fraud risks, and saves time and money when connected to data and the Blockchain network. This instance enables the real-time processing of insurance claims. 2. The Supply Chain: Blockchain tracks from real-time delivery of medical supplies from manufacturers to reduce the risk of human errors in remitting transactions; integrating Blockchain into an organization’s supply chain can increase productivity and quality control. Organizations can use this data to calculate supply chain labor costs and carbon emissions. Another growing application of a Blockchain-based supply chain in healthcare is organ transplantation. 3. Medical Investigation: Besides the apparent benefits, electronic health records can expand to include industry research. Medical research is only successful if the data is high quality and easily accessible. Blockchain grants the ownership rights to patients that can be beneficial for research purposes if given adequate consent. It would allow research institutions to collect open data to advance clinical research and public health reporting. Blockchain characteristics such as decentralization, data provenance, reliability, and support for smart contracts are ideal for advancing modern healthcare systems. What is Hyperledger? Linux Foundation has developed Hyperledger, which is an open-source community-based platform. Hyperledger provides libraries, rules, appropriate frameworks, and global tools for developing enterprise blockchain initiatives.It helps improve the performance, efficiency, and scalable transactions across a wide range of industries. On the global level, leading businesses from various fields like banking, finance, Internet of Things (IoT), and supply chain collaborate with Hyperledger.The popularity of Hyperledger is increasing as it provides an organizational structure for developing a range of blockchain-based solutions in various industries. Why is Hyperledger the best option for the Healthcare system? Hyperledger is considered the best option for implementing the healthcare system as it gives extensive control over smart contracts. Various computer languages, including Javascript and Node.js, are helpful for smart contracts. In contrast, only seven and fifteen transactions per second are performed on Bitcoin and Ethereum. But, Hyperledger has a transaction speed of up to 3000 transactions per second without using cryptocurrencies as a motivator. This speed results in low transaction cost with high transaction throughput. Top Healthcare projects with Hyperledger Implementation 1. KitChain: Kitchen is a pharmaceutical clinical supply solution that uses Blockchain to lower reliance on paper trials. It has constructed a secure trust system and creates an immutable record for tracking and shipment. Leading pharmaceutical companies like UPS, Pfizer, and GSK collaborate to establish a common supply chain model. 2. Axuall: With the use of Hyperledger Indy and Sorvin Network, Axull ensures real-time verification of credentials and identities. It minimizes the doctor’s time spent on unnecessary paperwork and improves their efficiency in practicing medicine. Physicians can use their complete compliant credential set to participate in Axuall’s digital network with associated healthcare systems. The cryptographic structure of Hyperledger Indy ensures the legitimacy of the physician’s identity. 3. MELLODDY: The MELLODDY Project aims to scale up machine learning techniques in drug discovery. It achieves this by utilizing Amazon Web Service technologies, which permit only transmitting non-sensitive data central dispatcher enables each partner to share a standard model. Substra from Hyperledger Fabric facilitates the traceability of operations that ensure the secure distribution of machine learning tasks. While MELLODDY is designed to prevent sensitive information from leaking in a standard model, it improves predictive performance by leveraging all available data. Hyperledger Healthcare Applications and Vaccine Distribution Since the outbreak of Covid-19, medical research facilities and ingenuity have supported the timely vaccine distribution on time. DTL and IoT are the best combinations to reduce inefficiency and improve supply chain accountability and transparency. Hyperleder Fabric makes it possible to integrate IoT to ensure the authentication of data in the supply chain management, like the origin of vaccine and its traceability which is a crucial part of supply chain management. Final Thoughts: The Hyperledger community has grown and evolved quickly over three years, delivering fully staked enterprise-grade solutions. Related","[Hyperledger]","NULL"
"What Are The Security Risks In Metaverse For Users?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/risks-in-metaverse-for-users/","Blog Post","26/05/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","When Facebook — now known as Meta — declared its plans to embrace the technology and desire to alter the way we related again in 2021, the metaverse re-entered the conversation. Although the technology is still a few years away, it’s becoming evident that the framework for a new metaverse-based Internet is being laid. However, as with today’s Internet, inherent hazards and security concerns exist, including privacy, financial, and mental health issues. We need to address these issues as we move toward a world of digital connectivity. While the entire potential of virtual reality environments is still being conceived and appraised, one thing is sure; the users should understand certain risk factors. This article will explore risk factors for the users while using metaverse. Table of Contents • What is metaverse? • Why are Companies making investments in the metaverse? • Risks factors in Metaverse for Users What is metaverse? Metaverse is a new digital platform that uses Blockchain and digital identity technologies to link users through a shared metaverse or online 3D reality. Metaverse harnesses the potential of Blockchain to bring people together in a digital world to build, engage, and transact in a more efficient, secure, and cost-effective way. “Beyond” is implied by the term “meta,” whereas “verse” refers to the “universe.” Furthermore, some people use the term metaverse to refer to virtual worlds in which players can travel and interact; for example, a world in which developers can create buildings, parks, signs, and other items that do not exist in reality. Massive hovering overhead light exhibitions and well-known districts are among the attractions (where the rules of three-dimensional spacetime are ignored, and free-combat zones where people can go hunting and kill each other). Why are Companies making investments in the metaverse? The primary patterns suggest that the events, games, and certain forms of social interactions will adopt the metaverse first. With the spread of remote work beginning in 2020, it is conceivable to imagine several work situations that will profit from this notion. This is the case with virtual meetings, product presentations, and games. Suppose employees are unable to participate in remote working. In that case, their virtual avatars may be a good idea to “meet in person.” The conference will be more immersive, and employees will be more engaged. At the same time, if people gather at an event, meeting, or playing video games in their avatars, it is an excellent opportunity for the companies to promote their brands and earn more revenue than traditional advertising. Many companies like Stell Artois, Nike, Vans, Renner, Gucci, etc., have already started their investment in the metaverse. This initiative will, in turn, lead to the popularization of virtual reality. Risks factors in Metaverse for Users 1. Identity: Many experts fear that if rigorous security measures are not adopted, identity theft in the metaverse may become even more accessible. In the real world, identity theft is now a multibillion-dollar industry; recent research estimated that identity theft damages were $24 billion. According to cybersecurity studies, cases have increased by more than 50% since 2020. 2. Unauthorized data Collection: Legitimate businesses will also acquire users’ data. On the other hand, virtual reality has the potential to push data collection to a level that may not be accessible to some people. Virtual reality headsets, for example, might hypothetically allow third parties to collect increasingly sensitive personal data, including voiceprint data, biometric data, and even facial geometry. 3. Cyberbullying in Virtual Games: The metaverse’s mental health and well-being have already made headlines. Cyberbullying is still a severe menace to teenagers and young adults. The impacts of cyberbullying are well-documented, ranging from low self-esteem to suicidal tendencies, particularly among teenagers. In February 2022, a woman claimed that three to four male avatars harassed her (her avatar) in a virtual game. According to experts, because our experience in the metaverse is as genuine as our experience in the physical world, pain and suffering are likewise real and profound. 4. Impact on Mental Health: Other dangers are more challenging to avoid in a virtual environment. Many free-to-play games, for example, rely on advertisements to fund their development. Malicious persons may substitute visuals that cause motion sickness or even epileptic convulsions for the adverts. Images like these might be sent to a virtual reality headset. 5. Ransomware Attacks: Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts your files and prevents you or anyone else from accessing them. It will then display a message demanding you to pay a particular amount of money to regain access to your data, thus the term ‘ransomware.’ In a metaverse environment, you can probably see how this might be problematic. Your metaverse profile will have more information than a regular social media profile and sensitive information. Imagine being unable to access your financial accounts or personal information. In a metaverse environment, this can be not easy. 6. Risk to National security with Deepfakes: In a world where information is king, experts are concerned that fraudulent information campaigns delivered via deepfaked audio and video snippets endanger our country’s security. Deepfakes are modified video or audio clips appearing and sounding like someone else. Deepfaking is similar to face swapping, but it uses sophisticated artificial intelligence algorithms to collect data about humans from several perspectives so that it may be superimposed on the existing video. 7. Risks at Shared Spaces: Shared spaces come with their dangers.The metaverse is built on the idea of bringing people together. While this can be beneficial in certain respects, it can raise issues. You can find groups of like-minded people and form great communities on the Internet nowadays. However, you will have to deal with people who hold contrary viewpoints in the metaverse. According to studies, people behave differently in a virtual world than in the actual world. This experience is particularly evident in multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), where veteran players criticize newcomers and even abuse females. Final Thoughts: As we develop our actual virtual existence, where all activities will take place in the digital realm, the list will undoubtedly grow and evolve. For those interested in the concept, it’s worth keeping an eye on how the metaverse’s new onslaught will affect the virtual and, crucially, the real world. May it be fruitful and hopeful for us humans. What did you think of the content? Take the opportunity to read another article about raising issues. Thank You! Related","[Metaverse and Web3]","NULL"
"What is Smart Contract Oracle In Blockchain System?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-smart-contract-oracle/","Blog Post","24/05/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","What exactly is a smart contract oracle? Here is an exhaustive handbook to help you understand the fundamentals and advanced concepts of Smart Contract Oracles. Let’s get started! Is blockchain the best example of 21st-century technological innovation? It certainly is! At the same time, it is embroiled in several controversies due to its setbacks. The primary functionality of blockchain is to allow individuals and organizations to exchange digital assets without centralized third parties. On the contrary, blockchain can only execute simple transactions, implying the need for smart contracts. In recent years, the role of smart contracts in blockchain-based applications has evolved significantly. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, for example, has increased the versatility and programmability of smart contracts. However, smart contracts need to be improved by their inability to access external information from the real world. The following discussion explains how these oracles aid in the resolution of blockchain technology‘s most critical problem. It is necessary to know more about the concept of a smart contract to understand smart contract oracles. What is Smart Contract? Smart contracts are self-contained computer programs that can execute automatically when certain conditions are met. Smart contracts allow you to share anything of value with strangers more transparent and conflict-free. Smart contracts can also be considered vending machines, albeit ones powered by blockchain. We can compare smart contracts with vending machines. Like in the case of vending machines delivering the goods on insertion of money, Ethereum-based smart contracts rely on Ether to execute code according to predefined rules. Smart contracts are pieces of code that run without any innovative implications or legal significance. However, traditional perceptions of smart contracts have shifted dramatically in recent years. Recent trends in smart contracts have strongly emphasized determinism and immutability. After deployment, the code of smart contracts becomes immutable. As a result, you can delete the smart contract while keeping the transaction history on the blockchain on which it was running. Furthermore, even though an agent creates them, smart contracts feature self-ownership. Any private keys do not control smart contracts and cannot self-execute. What is Smart Contract Oracle? An oracle blockchain, by definition, is connected to the outside world. Oracles assist in retrieving and verifying external data for blockchain and smart contracts by utilizing market data feeds and online APIs. Depending on the use case, smart contracts may require various forms of data. Smart contracts, for example, may require demand, supply, or price input data. Blockchain techs can use oracles in smart contract applications to query the data source and request specific information. The oracles establish a connection between the data source and the blockchain-to-data-feed interface. Classification of Smart Contract Oracles: The oracle’s source refers to the data’s origins, whether from hardware or software. The trust aspect in smart contract oracles highlights the centralized or decentralized character of the oracle smart contract. The direction of information, which could be outgoing or inbound, also influences the classification of smart contract oracles. Let’s look at the many forms of smart contract oracles to grasp oracles better. . Hardware Oracles: When smart contracts must interact with the actual world, hardware smart contract oracles are essential. Hardware oracles’ basic design allows them to gather data from the physical world while also assuring that it is available to smart contracts. Hardware oracles can supply information from electronic sensors, information reading devices, and barcode scanners. The job of hardware oracles focuses on converting real-world events into digital values that smart contracts can understand. . Software Oracles: Software oracles are designed for interaction with online sources. The oracles then send the data to the blockchain from online sources. The data for software oracles could come from any data source on the internet, including websites, online databases, and servers. Software oracles with internet access significantly benefit from providing information to smart contracts while ensuring real-time data delivery. Real-time trading information, interest rates, and digital asset prices are examples of the information provided by software oracles. . Contract-based oracles: These are another well-known form of oracle blockchain. Contract-based oracles are designed to be used by only one smart contract. As a result, if someone wishes to deploy a variety of smart contracts, they’ll need to create a sufficient number of contract-based roles. The most significant disadvantage of contract-specific oracles is the high cost and time required to maintain them. Companies that need to collect data from various sources may find contract-specific oracles unfeasible. However, oracles for individual smart contracts can be designed based on unique use cases. Above importantly, developers have good flexibility in customizing the smart contract oracle to their own needs. . Inbound Oracles and Outbound Oracles: Inbound Oracles can transmit information to smart contracts from external sources. Similarly, outbound oracles are involved in sending data to real-world recipients. On the other hand, a smart lock is an excellent example of an outbound oracle. The smart contract uses an outbound oracle to send the information about the fund deposit. . Centralized and Decentralized Oracles: The only information provider for smart contracts is centralized oracles, which a single party controls. Relying on a specific source of information carries significant risks. The oracle’s control would considerably impact the contract’s efficiency. Furthermore, any harmful involvement of rogue agents could directly impact the smart contract. As a result, the single point of failure is the most severe issue with the Oracle smart contract in its centralized form. As a result, centralized oracles can make contracts less resistant to assaults and flaws. On the other hand, decentralized oracles have similar goals to public blockchains, focusing on avoiding counterparty hazards. Decentralized oracles could increase the trustworthiness of data provided to smart contracts. How? Decentralized oracles do not depend on a single source of information, and several oracles must determine data validity and accuracy. Because of their functions, decentralized oracles are sometimes known as consensus oracles. Oracle Applications Using cryptocurrencies alongside real-world contracts is one of the most popular functions of an oracle. Assume a person is selling a vehicle in return for cryptocurrencies. You can create an oracle that transfers facts from the blockchain to the real world and then use it to transfer the title as soon as the monies are transferred. We can use oracles to make informal agreements, such as “I’ll give you ten tokens if my team wins the game.” An oracle can monitor results and transfer tokens once a winner is declared. Oracles are also helpful in handling derivatives, insurance, and other risk management strategies. Farmers can use oracles to handle agricultural derivatives that provide a payout if bad weather kills their crop. The oracle can monitor the temperature and ensure that the farmer receives insurance benefits if a certain amount of rain does not fall on time. Oracles may also assist with cryptocurrency investments, which is a beneficial aspect. For investors, blockchain oracles can keep an eye on cryptos, stock prices, and foreign exchange rates and subsequently buy or sell cryptocurrency in response to these external changes. A blockchain oracle makes it significantly easier for a clever investor to keep a portfolio of various assets up to date. As you can see, oracles perform a wide range of vital functions. Their capacity to bridge the gap between blockchains and real-world events gives blockchains utility. Users can incorporate blockchains into their daily lives using oracles. The Oracle Problem As smart contracts make decisions based on data given by Oracle networks, the latter becomes an unprecedented unit of the fundamental process. The primary concern in creating oracles is the potential for compromise. If the oracle is compromised, so will the smart contract that relies on it. The Oracle Problem is the name given to this situation. It is divided into two sections: Individual blockchains need help accessing external data sources. Using centralized oracles run by a single party compromises the potential of smart contracts, introducing security problems. Because oracles are not a part of the primary blockchain consensus, they do not provide the security features that public blockchains do. Furthermore, the trust difficulty between third-party oracles and trustless smart contract execution still needs to be solved. Finally, unplanned intrusions can endanger the system, such as when a hacker gains access to the data and modifies it while transiting between oracles and smart contracts. However, decentralized oracles are working to resolve these concerns to maintain a healthy blockchain environment. How Oracle Works? All Oracle networks perform three critical functions, which are as follows: Data collection from a reputable external source Using a signed message to send the information on-chain Making the data source available to end users by securely storing it in a smart contract. Once the data is saved in a smart contract, other automated agreements can readily access it via message calls referencing the retrieve function. Ethereum nodes or network participants can access the data directly via the Oracle ecosystem’s storage area. Methods for Creating an Oracle Oracle solutions can be installed in three different methods. Immediate-read Oracles provide data needed to make quick choices, such as ‘is this number bigger than 10?’ Users who seek such information do so on a ‘just-in-time’ basis, implying that the lookup occurs only when the query is provided. Dial codes, airport identification, and so on are examples. 1. Publish-subscribe This oracle covers provides services for changeable data managed by an on-chain smart contract or verified for updates by an off-chain protocol. This configuration includes price feeds, user traffic statistics, economic or statistical data, etc. 2. Request-response The configuration is useful when the data space for a smart contract is quite large, and users are expected to consume just a tiny portion of it at any given time. It combines on-chain smart contracts with off-chain infrastructure. Oracles in this location monitor requests, retrieve, and provide data as rapidly as possible. The steps involved in this case are as follows: A Dapp has made a request. Take the query and split it up. Check that payment and data access permissions are in place. Seek reliable facts from a third party. If necessary, encrypt it. Sign the documents. Distribute the transaction over the network. Additional transactions, such as alerts, can be scheduled. Blockchain's Most Important Applications Oracle Decentralized Finance, or DeFi: has emerged as one of the most popular concepts in recent years. The sector is expanding rapidly, necessitating the most significant technologies and resources. Oracles are essential in supporting the DeFi cluster because they enable users to access financial data relating to assets and markets readily. For example, money markets dealing with virtual assets use price oracles to determine investors’ borrowing capacity. These oracles aid in determining if an investor’s position is undercollateralized and subject to liquidation. Furthermore, automated Market Makers employ price oracles to concentrate liquidity at the current market price, which helps to improve efficiency. Blockchain Gaming and NFTs: With the help of oracles, smart contracts locate their home in non-financial fields such as NFTs and blockchain games. NFTs are very dynamic and subject to fluctuations in external events. Furthermore, compute oracles aid in creating verifiable randomness, which provides randomized features to NFTs. These oracles are also used to select random game winners or NFT drops. Verifiable randomness is used in e-games to increase engagement and unpredictability in their ecosystems. Business Entities: Cross-chain oracles offer entities a dependable blockchain-enabled middleware solution. They make it simple for businesses to integrate their backend channels with any blockchain. Oracles assist organizations in providing smart contract support to their users without incurring the expense of constructing a relationship with particular blockchains. Insurance companies employ input oracles to execute smart contracts on their decentralized clusters. These oracles confirm insurable events during claim processing by providing access to physical sensors, web APIs, and legal data. Claim payouts are facilitated via output oracles across other blockchain networks or traditional payment systems. Environmental Responsibility: Hybrid contracts increase environmental sustainability by improving and motivating users who participate in green activities. Oracles use sensor readings, satellite imaging, and advanced technology to give smart contracts with seamless access to environmental data. The smart contracts then reward individuals and businesses that promote the concept of sustainable consumption. They are also expanding assistance for additional carbon credits to mitigate the detrimental effects of climate change. Conclusion: Blockchain technology has yet to find popular applications due to its inability to access external data. As a result, a dependable system for providing external data to blockchains and smart contracts, such as a smart contract oracle, could give promising results. According to the use cases, blockchain oracles assist smart contracts in accessing external, real-world information. As a result, oracles could broaden the scope of blockchain implementation in various real-world applications. Stay tuned for next exciting topic.

"How Cryptographic Hash Functions are Used in Blockchain Technology","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-hashing-in-cryptography/","Blog Post","18/05/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","In the earlier article, we discussed cryptography in the blockchain and why it is necessary for the security of the blockchain ecosystem. Today’s article will discuss how is a hash function in cryptography useful in Blockchain technology. As we know, Cryptography refers to the practice of developing protocols to prevent third parties from accessing and viewing data. Modern cryptographic applications combine disciplines such as physics, math, computer science, engineering, and others. Hash code is a process that transforms any data form into a unique text string. Any data can be hashed, regardless of its type, scale, length, or size. The result is a string of a fixed length. When blockchain was first used for cryptocurrencies, it employed a predetermined hashing algorithm for transactions of varying lengths. The hash function is unaffected by the length of the input. A Hash is a name given to the output. Table of Contents • How is Cryptographic Hashing useful in Blockchain? • The properties of hash functions How is Cryptographic Hashing useful in Blockchain? One of the significant highlights in blockchain cryptography illustrated adequately is cryptographic hashing. It is a fundamental component of blockchain technology. The most important feature of blockchain is immutability, which is enabled by hashing. Cryptographic hashing encryption does not require the use of keys. In contrast, hashing in cryptography employs a cipher or an algorithm to generate a hash value of a specific length from the input. Hashing takes any length string as input and produces a fixed-length output. The SHA-256 hash function is one of the most typical applications of hashing in the blockchain. Hash in blockchain has several distinguishing characteristics contributing to its usefulness in blockchain cryptography. Here’s a rundown of the characteristics that make cryptographic hash functions suitable for blockchain applications. 1. Deterministic cryptographic hash functions No matter how often you enter a specific input, the hash function always returns the same length output. So, whether you enter a string of 3 or 200 characters, you will get the exact length output, i.e., 32 characters in a fixed string with a combination of numbers and letters. 2. The uniqueness of output is the second important characteristic that emerges in the case of cryptographic hash functions. The exact output is created even if two different inputs are applied using cryptographic hash functions. As a result, they can provide unique functionalities for avoiding collisions. 3. Cryptographic hash functions are also strongly associated with the trait of irreversibility. Using current technology and techniques, it is virtually impossible to deduce the original input from the output. 4. The faster computation of hashes is another significant feature that establishes the significance of hash functions in blockchain and cryptography. Hash functions can generate outputs more quickly, increasing the likelihood of faster transaction completion. 5. The avalanche effect is a prominent feature of cryptographic hash algorithms. The avalanche effect states that a minor change in the input results can result in a completely different output. The Secure Hash Algorithm (#SHA) is the most widely used cryptographic hash function, with many variants, including SHA1, SHA256, MD5, and SHA512. Each cryptographic hash function has a distinct function, which is as follows: . MD5, also known as the Message-Digest algorithm, aids in generating a 128-bit hash value. . SHA1 is an improved version of SHA designed by NIST and released by FIPS or Federal Information Processing Standard. . The SHA256 function computes hash values using 32-bit words, and the message digest is 256 bits long. . The SHA512 function calculates hash values using 64-bit words, and the message digest is 512 bits long. As a result, cryptographic hash functions provide unique mathematical benefits with various appealing properties.

"What Is Cryptography In The Blockchain Tech?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-cryptography-in-the-blockchain-tech/","Blog Post","13/05/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","The assurance of user information and transaction data security is crucial for blockchain’s growing popularity. So, what role does cryptography play in blockchain? The following article examines the fundamentals of cryptography and blockchain and the many types of cryptography used in blockchain networks. Why is Blockchain Cryptography crucial? Blockchain technology has arisen as one of the most innovative application models, capable of merging consensus processes, distributed data storage, digital encryption technology, peer-to-peer transmission, and other computing technologies. It has given a secure and decentralized platform for information exchange. Digital encryption technologies are, in fact, critical components of blockchain technology, attracting attention to blockchain cryptography. The term “blockchain” refers to a distributed database with decentralization, security, traceability, reliability, and immutability. Blockchain eliminates traditional techniques to maintain central nodes in favor of a new model that allows various users to manage nodes jointly. As a result, it can delegate data oversight to numerous parties while maintaining the appropriate trustworthiness and data integrity levels. Another significant component of blockchain is the three different types of blockchain systems. Public, private, and alliance chains are examples of blockchain platforms. Every node in a public chain might join or leave the blockchain, depending on their choices. On the other hand, private blockchains establish strict criteria for determining the eligibility of participating nodes. The alliance chain is managed collaboratively by the various involved entities. Blockchain has become closely identified with the banking industry over time. However, technology has demonstrated great potential for contributing value to several sectors while transforming our society’s fundamental foundations. The blockchain has no single node because it is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network. These nodes are distrustful of one another. As a result, while maintaining transaction integrity, blockchain must offer sufficient security for transaction information across unprotected routes. As a result, cryptography becomes a prerequisite for blockchain to protect user transaction information and privacy while assuring data consistency. What is cryptography in blockchain? In its most literal meaning, cryptography refers to secrets. As a result, cryptography technology aims to provide total or pseudo-anonymity. The critical applications of cryptography are to ensure the security of participants and transactions, prevent double-spending, and ensure that central authorities have no control over operations. Cryptography has a wide range of applications. In some circumstances, it aids in the security of various network transactions. On the other side, users can use it to validate the transfer of digital assets and tokens. By combining cryptography and encryption keys, blockchain applications use the concept of real-world signatures. Cryptography systems employ advanced mathematical codes to store and transfer data values in secure formats. As a result, it assures that only the individuals for whom the transaction or data is meant can access, read, and process it and verify the participants’ and transaction’s legitimacy. Significance of Cryptography in Blockchain Let us take one example to explain the complicated topic of cryptography. Both radio stations and radio communications use radio waves. But radio stations are available to all, and anyone can listen to the broadcast. On the contrary, radio communications are functional to only a few people with authority to hear, as in the case of soldiers. Defense-level communications are encrypted and highly secured. In the same manner, cryptography has significance in blockchain technology. Cryptography is a mechanism for sending secure messages between two or more parties. Before transmitting a message to the receiver, the sender uses a specific type of key and algorithm to encrypt it. The recipient then uses decryption to recover the original message. So, what is the most crucial part of cryptographic operations? The response explicitly mentions encryption keys. Because encryption keys are used, unauthorized recipients or readers cannot read a message, data value, or transaction. They’re the best tools for ensuring that only the intended receivers may read and process a particular message, data item, or transaction. As a result, keys can impart ‘crypto’ traits to data. Most blockchain applications, especially in the public blockchain, do not explicitly require sending secret, encrypted messages. On the other hand, a new generation of blockchain apps uses several types of cryptography encryption to ensure transaction security and total anonymity. Over the years, several new tools connected to cryptography applications in blockchain have arisen, each with its own features. Hashing and digital signatures are two critical instances of the devices. With a comprehensive explanation of the fundamentals of blockchain cryptography, it is clear that cryptography refers to the activity of developing protocols that restrict third parties from accessing and viewing data. Cryptography’s current uses combine various fields, including physics, math, computer science, engineering, etc. However, the focus of blockchain cryptography applications is mostly on words like encryption, decryption, cipher, and keys. The encryption and decryption applications in cryptography must be familiar to the readers. Cipher is a mathematical technique that aids in encrypting data by following a set of well-defined procedures. The tiny amount of information necessary to obtain output from the cryptography technique is critical. Let’s look at digital signatures and hashing, the two components that establish cryptography’s important function in the blockchain. Types of Cryptography We can encrypt data in a variety of methods. Each has advantages and disadvantages, and we can combine them to create a more robust encryption method. Let’s have a look at the three main types of cryptography. 1. Symmetric Cryptography: The first type of online encryption was symmetric cryptography, sometimes known as symmetric key cryptography. Symmetric cryptography converts data into a cipher—or encrypted code. A key is required to decrypt the cipher. In symmetric cryptography, the transmitter and receiver utilize an identical key to encrypt and decrypt the data. Symmetric cryptography can quickly process vast amounts of data because it is so simple. However, as you could expect, sharing keys became an issue. Consider how you would share a password with someone. Hackers can quickly read your password if you SMS or email it to them. You nearly have to have a password for your password! Similarly, sharing keys from sender to recipient introduced a vulnerability that hackers might swiftly exploit. Asymmetric cryptography is helpful in this situation. 2. Asymmetric cryptography: The transmitter and recipient have distinct keys in asymmetric cryptography. One key is used to encrypt the data, while another is used to decrypt the data at the other end. But if the two people have essentially different passwords, how do you ensure that when the data is transferred, only the intended recipient can access it? In short, how do you tell the code to open for the proper use if you don’t share keys? Asymmetric cryptography employs a two-key scheme per user: public and private keys to address this issue. Your public key is unique to the user, but anyone may see it. Only you have access to your private key. It’s similar to a bank account PIN. The public and private keys collaborate. As a result, the individual transmitting information in a transaction can send it to your public key. Then, to decrypt data delivered to your public key, you must first unlock it with your private key. To send a message to Mr. X, we must encrypt it with their public key. Then, using their private key, only they may open it. Alternatively, if Mr. X adds a digital signature to a chunk of data using their private key, anyone online may decipher it and confirm it is them. 3. Hash Cryptography: Hashing is the ultimate type of cryptography. A cryptographic hash is a text string. Any plaintext data can be hashed and converted into a unique string of text using a hashing algorithm. The text is entirely meaningless. For example, the word “Hello” can be converted into the sha1 hash: “f7ff9e8b7bb2e09b70935a5d785e0cc5d9d0abf0.” Once the cryptographic hash function has processed the original data, you cannot reverse the procedure. That is how cryptographic hashing differs from symmetric or asymmetric encryption, which requires a key to decipher. There is no way to derive the actual data from a hash you’ve never seen before. The same data will always create the same hash as long as the same hash method is utilized. Users can tell if data was modified along the route by comparing it to the final hash. However, hackers have discovered ways to collect many hashes and match them against hashes for common words and phrases. If they find a match, they will understand what the hash indicates. In a data breach, this is how hackers get passwords. Hashing is also crucial because it lets you fit a piece of information into a small string of text called a “hash.” No matter how long or detailed the data is, the length of a hash is always the same. So, hashing is a way to pack data into a smaller space. Advantages of Cryptography There are a lot of good things about cryptography in the blockchain. Here are some of them: Encryption: Asymmetric encryption is used in cryptography to ensure that transactions on their network protect information and communications from being shared or accessed by people who shouldn’t be able to. Immutability: This cryptography function is essential for blockchain because it makes it possible for blocks to be securely linked to other blocks and ensures that the data stored in the blockchain is correct. It also provides that an attacker can’t get a valid signature for unopposed queries and the signatures that go with them from previous queries. Security: Cryptography makes it easy to keep track of transactions by using public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt data. Cryptographic hashing makes it impossible to change data, which makes the blockchain safer. Scalability: Cryptography ensures that the transaction can’t be undone and gives all users confidence that the digital ledger is correct. You can safely record an unlimited number of transactions on the network. Non-repudiation: A digital signature offers a service called “non-repudiation,” which keeps the sender’s message from being turned down. This benefit can be linked to collision resistance, which means that because each input value has its hash function, there is no chance that two messages sent at the same time will have the same hash value. This feature makes it easy to tell one message from another. Keep hackers away: Hackers can’t change the data with a digital signature because if the data is changed, the digital signature is no longer valid. It uses cryptography to keep hackers from getting to data, making cryptography on the blockchain impossible to stop. Limitations of Cryptography Here are some things that blockchain cryptography can’t do: Difficult Access to information: Information that is heavily encrypted and digitally signed can be hard to access even for a legitimate user at the most important time for making a decision. An intruder can attack the network and shut it down. High availability: It is one of the essential parts of information security, but cryptography can’t guarantee it. You need to use other methods to protect against threats like denial of service or a complete breakdown of information systems. No Protection Against Vulnerabilities: Cryptography does not protect against weaknesses and threats from protocols, procedures, and poorly designed systems. Defense infrastructure needs to be set up in a way that solves these problems. Expensive: Cryptography is costly because it takes time and money. Setting up and taking care of a critical public infrastructure, which is needed for public key encryption, costs a lot of money. Sending messages and processing information takes longer when cryptography is used. Vulnerability: The security of cryptographic techniques is based on how challenging and complicated the maths is. Any improvement in solving these maths problems can leave cryptographic methods open to attack. Conclusion: Cryptography is essential to how blockchain technology works on the inside. Blockchain wallets and transactions are based on public key encryption, cryptographic hashing functions make blockchains unchangeable, and Merkle trees organize transactions and make blockchains more efficient. The basic ideas behind cryptography are the same as those behind blockchain technology. Digital signatures are reliable tools for encrypting communication on a blockchain network, but cryptographic hash has more potential for encryption. Thank You! Related","[Blockchain]","NULL"
"Metaverse & VR are different or same? What do you Think?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-are-the-metaverse-and-virtual-reality/","Blog Post","10/05/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Many works of science fiction have portrayed virtual worlds in which people can take on any persona they like. One of the most exciting subjects in modern technology is the concept of a digital realm where you may flee from the actual world. You’ve probably heard a lot about the latest metaverse discoveries recently. There is a deep-rooted link between metaverse virtual reality technology. This situation has led to the debate about metaverse vs. virtual reality comparisons. People unfamiliar with the subject may believe that the metaverse is simply a virtual environment that can be accessed using virtual reality headsets. Are metaverse and virtual reality the same thing? No. A lot of information is available to distinguish the metaverse from virtual reality. The following talk provides a complete description of both technologies to assist you in determining between the metaverse and virtual reality. Table of Contents • Why are the Metaverse and Virtual Reality creating buzz? • What is Metaverse? • What is Virtual Reality? • Difference Between Metaverse and Virtual Reality Why are the Metaverse and Virtual Reality creating buzz? After giant firms began investing in it, the metaverse became one of the hottest subjects of conversation in the tech world. Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Sony, and many other behemoths launch their metaverse platforms. The metaverse concept gained traction after Facebook rebranded to Meta in October 2021. Why did Facebook go to such lengths? Surprisingly, the company’s statement that it has sold 10 million Oculus VR headsets has drawn much attention to virtual reality vs. metaverse comparisons. In many cases, the metaverse is similar to utilizing the internet in virtual surroundings. On the other hand, virtual reality would be just one of the tools for interacting with the metaverse. Let’s learn more about the metaverse and virtual reality to see how we can tell them apart. What is Metaverse? The first step in a metaverse vs. VR argument is understanding both concepts thoroughly. In his novel ” Snow Crash, ” the term “metaverse” was coined in 1992 by Neal Stephenson, a science fiction novelist, in his novel “Snow Crash.” The metaverse is described by Stephenson in the novel as a virtual realm where the protagonist can escape from the actual world. The protagonist created a new avatar utterly unlike him and went on a metaverse adventure. Years later, most metaverse definitions are consistent with Neal Stephenson’s concept. One popular interpretation of the metaverse is that it is the next step in evolving internet technologies. The metaverse is a three-dimensional virtual world that allows users to explore and engage with virtual locations, content, and services. Surprisingly, the metaverse enables different users to create virtual environments and solutions, creating a creator economy. Virtual reality and other technology, such as AR glasses, can be used to enter the metaverse. Users can access the metaverse via a personal computer or smartphone. As a result, the question “what is the difference between the metaverse and virtual reality” may be deduced from understanding that VR is not the metaverse. Whether the metaverse intended for virtual worlds or not? You might have doubts when considering prospective distinctions in the metaverse vs. virtual reality discussion. The metaverse isn’t just any virtual environment you can visit using virtual reality technology. Instead, it will be a shared and enduring virtual world that will supplement the real world. A more in-depth examination of how the metaverse differs from today’s internet can help address this question. You wouldn’t just be a gadget requesting information about the web in the metaverse. Metaverse users can utilize digital avatars to access internet content and virtual locations as if they were real people. Users can take part in numerous metaverse experiences as virtual avatars living in virtual space. There is no constraint for the users while using the metaverse as a shared and widespread virtual world. For example, you don’t have to exit a game to visit a virtual museum. What is Virtual Reality? As the name implies, virtual reality (VR) creates virtual environments powered by technology. Virtual reality is a three-dimensional environment created by computers from a technical standpoint. The virtual reality experience could be explored and interacted with in an immersive and engaging environment. In VR environments, users are engaged in the environments and can handle items or do various tasks. The definition of VR blurs the distinction between the metaverse and virtual reality. However, it’s vital to remember that virtual reality can only provide access to limited virtual worlds or experiences. Users can use special headgear and glasses associated with the PC to access the apps and enjoying VR experiences. Users’ immersive experiences with sensory elements in the virtual world, including sight and sound, are enhanced by specialized gadgets. Additionally, you can get VR systems that allow users to wear gloves equipped with sensing devices. Currently, the most common uses of virtual reality are in entertainment. On the other hand, virtual reality applications in education and medical and military applications have recently gained traction. Difference Between Metaverse and Virtual Reality 1. Definition: The metaverse is a virtual world that is open, shared, and persistent, allowing users to access 3D virtual spaces, solutions, and surroundings. On the other hand, virtual reality is a technique for constructing three-dimensional virtual environments with specialized functionalities. However, it is vital to highlight that the metaverse has no precise definition. As a result, VR has the upper hand in the description argument between virtual reality and the metaverse. You might wonder why the metaverse lacks a clear explanation when there is one right in front of us. It’s worth noting that the metaverse isn’t well defined. As a result, in the virtual reality vs. metaverse debate, VR has the definition advantage. You might be wondering why the metaverse lacks a clear definition while one exists right in front of our eyes. There are numerous definitions of the metaverse in this scenario. The metaverse is described in some definitions as an open, shared, and enduring digital world, while others refer to it as an embodied internet. As a result, there are only hazy explanations of the metaverse compared to virtual reality. 2. Technology: The technological limits are another essential consideration in the metaverse vs. virtual reality discussion. When it comes to virtual reality, there are some restrictions. You can only create more refined virtual experiences with advancements in VR technologies. In the end, virtual reality would be all about simulations and having fun with virtual worlds. The metaverse, on the other hand, has no such restrictions. Virtual reality technologies aren’t the sole source of power in the metaverse. Many different technologies, like augmented reality, blockchain, cryptocurrency, and connection technologies, drive the metaverse’s functionality. The metaverse, above all, is a vast virtual world that allows for integrating new technologies to provide greater functionality. 3. User experience: In a metaverse vs. VR discussion, the way users experience VR and the metaverse are also key comparison points. In the case of virtual reality, you can imagine yourself wearing a headset or other device that allows you to interact with the virtual world. Furthermore, virtual reality experiences are confined to many people, such as game players. By merging AR and VR technology, the metaverse creates a virtual reality similar to the real one. As a result, you can move around in virtual worlds as if you were in real life, although as a digital avatar. Above all, metaverse experiences aren’t restricted to specific locations.The metaverse allows players to visit, experience, and engage with other users. Other areas in the metaverse also distinguish between the metaverse and virtual reality in terms of experience quality. 4. Durability: Durability is the next pointer for distinguishing between the metaverse and virtual reality. In a virtual reality vs. metaverse comparison, virtual reality or VR systems are one of the favorites. The metaverse is still in progress, but you can already encounter virtual worlds thanks to VR technologies. Virtual reality experiences, on the other hand, end when the machine is turned off. Because it is a shared and enduring universe, the metaverse flips the script on VR in terms of persistence. Your digital avatar will remain in the metaverse even if you leave it. It would generally function with other users engaged in metaverse interaction. Final Thoughts: According to the ultimate summary of differences in the metaverse vs. virtual reality discussion, the metaverse is more than virtual reality. Virtual reality is effectively one of the metaverse’s cornerstone technologies. Users can access the metaverse through it. On the other hand, virtual reality is confined to a few features. On the other hand, the metaverse is a vast and ever-expanding virtual environment that would represent the internet in three dimensions. Users can visit virtual 3D environments in the metaverse as they can surf different web pages. Above all, the potential for introducing innovation into the metaverse is limitless.

"Why Multichain is Significant in the Blockchain Ecosystem?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-multichain/","Blog Post","05/05/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Blockchain has been characterized by its close-knit group and exclusivity until the last decade. Governments, organizations, institutional investors, and people have all begun to accept this expanding arena. Multichain solutions will transform the blockchain sector from a “fun new technology” to a vital, high-growth industry. This article will discuss what multichain is and why it is necessary. What is MultiChain? MultiChain is an open-source blockchain platform that allows users to construct and deploy private blockchain applications that work within or across businesses.The platform comes with a simple API and command-line interface that may be used to conduct financial transactions. Permissions management, data streams, native assets, data streams, and simple per-chain settings are just a few of the features included in MultiChain. Enterprise applications benefit from these high-end features in scalability, confidentiality, integration, and compliance. Setting up and managing a lightweight private network with developer-friendly and versatile tools is simple. It supports diverse programming languages, like Ruby, Python, JavaScript, C#, and PHP. Users can generate native tokens or assets on the network and transfer them across stakeholders. MultiChain is an off-the-shelf platform because it extends the Bitcoin protocol and Bitcoin Core APIs to mirror some of Bitcoin’s features. This uniqueness makes it compatible with many tools and open-source code built for Bitcoin, such as software libraries, online explorers, mobile wallets, and hardware security devices. Instead of homogeneity, nodes on the network merely require connectivity. This system means that all participating systems that install the program are linked together to form the MultiChain network, which can be within a company or between companies and shares the same transaction database. Why do users need Multichain? A group of programmers decided in 2014 to construct a database similar to Bitcoin but more suited to a controlled ecosystem. Coin Sciences, a software business, was the first to attempt Bitcoin 2.0, and the initiative was dubbed Coin Spark. After the Coin Spark project failed, Coin Sciences decided to construct MultiChain as a permissioned blockchain. MultiChain was created to improve blockchain technology by addressing the scalability and bloating issues that plague Bitcoin. MultiChain overcomes the linked challenges of mining cost and reduces the risk associated with openness by giving the privacy and control required through integrated user rights management. As a private blockchain, it assures network scalability by restricting shared data in every block, removing extraneous data, and increasing transaction speed. It also provides much-needed project privacy to organizations, as the blockchain’s activity is only accessible to selected parties. Mining blocks is less expensive because it is done by delegation rather than proof of work, although it is a branch of the Bitcoin network. As a result, it is more ecologically friendly than Bitcoin’s energy-intensive mining mechanism. Multichain software is suitable for financial systems and supply chain solutions because of its transaction speed and straightforward approach to data storage. Significance of MultiChain 1. Stream: This is the network’s private shared database. Streams are used for generic data retrieval, timestamping, and archiving on the blockchain; for example, a standard stream can store and retrieve raw data. Streams are made up of items, each with a timestamp, an optional key for data retrieval, digital signatures, and data. Streams are either open or closed when they are generated. Anyone with authority to send a blockchain transaction can write to open streams, whereas closed streams are confined to a variable list of permittees. 2. Permissioned: Access to the MultiChain network necessitates the creation of a permit by the network administrator, which is usually the developers by default. A developer can use the built-in tools to design and configure their network, including mining diversity, level of consensus, mining incentives, maximum block size, network access permissions, blockchain privacy, etc. Network transactions carrying specific metadata are used in MultiChain to give and revoke rights. All powers, including administrator rights to manage other users’ privileges, are immediately granted to the miner of the initial “genesis” block. The first admin can assign mining responsibilities to any network stakeholder, transfer asset ownership, and share the network’s database or stream with any other node. 3. Peer-to-Peer Connection: When the nodes in a blockchain interact, hand-shaking occurs in MultiChain. Each node’s identity is represented by an address with a list of permissions. As a result, nodes transmit messages to each other, and if they do not receive satisfactory notifications, the peer-to-peer (P2P) connection is terminated. 4. Assets: On MultiChain, a token is referred to as an asset. MultiChain allows native assets to be created and tracked at the blockchain network level. It has built-in blockchain tokens, both the chain’s native currency and new assets that may be issued on top of it. The number of assets in transactions is tracked and verified by every MultiChain node. 5. Mining: Mining is carried out by a group of network admins using distributed consensus among identified block validators. Mining is confined to a set of identifiable entities. Each block has only one validator to avoid a minority monopoly of the mining process; unlike previous blockchains, which require all nodes to validate and store transactions, MultiChain does not replicate data across all nodes.The size of blocks is reduced by encoding hashes of large pieces of data within transactions rather than the data itself. Each piece of data’s decryption key is only shared with those supposed to see it. Unlike Bitcoin mining, where nodes must solve a mathematical riddle, any permitted node can generate new blocks after a random timeout, subject to a diversity parameter. MultiChain uses a mining diversity parameter to achieve this scheme, limited to 0 mining diversity 1. Transaction fees and block rewards are fixed to $0 by default, so miners don’t need to be compensated for delivering this service other than their general interest in the blockchain’s seamless operation. Miners can be compensated in local currency in exchange for tokenized assets by network members. 6. Scalability: Multichain uses multiple chain data storing approach to tackle scalability difficulties. Depending on your preferences, every data item published to a stream can be on-chain or off-chain. Up to 2000 transactions per second can be processed with Multichain (TPS). It never repeats the data of every node. Final Thoughts: MultiChain Enterprise provides sophisticated blockchain technology for enterprise applications, including scalability and high transaction speeds, and the ability to connect and interact with many blockchains. Permissioned blockchains, it may be assumed, are valuable in the regulated financial industry, and companies like banks are beginning to employ them. Although setting up a private blockchain is costly, particularly in the early stages, MultiChain requires you to establish each node before each transaction. Regardless, MultiChain is widely considered one of the greatest enterprise blockchain apps available. The MultiChain program is used by over a hundred organizations for financial transactions.

"Why we need Crypto Launchpad? What are top 5 Launchpads?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-cryptocurrency-launchpad/","Blog Post","03/05/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Early contributors to successful organizations always reap the most significant rewards. They are entitled to the benefits of success because they have stuck with the initiative from the beginning. A crypto launchpad is the most incredible place to look for a startup project. Crypto launchpads almost guarantee such returns, albeit they come with hazards that potential investors should know before putting their money at risk. You’ll understand why individuals look for the greatest crypto launchpads if you’ve ever invested in a launchpad startup and lost or made money.The crypto business is growing, and many projects rely on the decentralized world to raise funds. 2021 has provided us with many new coin launchpads. Table of Contents • What is Cryptocurrency Launchpad? • Why use a Crypto Launchpad? • 5 Best Cryptocurrency Launchpads What is Cryptocurrency Launchpad? Crypto launchpads, also known as crypto incubators, are platforms that allow blockchain-based enterprises to generate funds while offering their investors access to early-stage token sales. Early access to sales implies investors can get a good deal before the market opens to the public. Because the cost of launching in a crypto launchpad is inexpensive (or non-existent), many companies are turning to them for funding. Both creators and investors benefit from launching a project through a launchpad. Evaluators rigorously vetted new projects at top crypto launchpads, and a third party undertakes a #KYC (Know Your Customer) process for further user verification. Using a launchpad to launch a project gives new founders access to a network of crypto investors and enthusiasts eager to learn about new projects. Why use a Crypto Launchpad? Crypto launchpads link investors and entrepreneurs, allowing startups to raise funds for project development while early investors gain access to early-stage deals. For projects: Founders get what they need — funding to drive their ventures forward — by launching their projects through a launchpad. A launchpad also introduces a project to a large community of crypto enthusiasts. For investors: Early investors (in VC deals) typically get tokens at a lower price than when the token goes public. For example, the CryoWar sale on BullStarter surged by more than 120X from its initial price. 5 Best Cryptocurrency Launchpads 1. Binance: The first launchpad based on the BSC Network is BSCPad. Platform’s decentralized architecture facilitates funding, token distribution, and greater liquidity for blockchain-based enterprises. The now-famous “two-round allocation model” distinguishes BSCPad from other launchpads. This approach provides a guaranteed allocation per Tier, which investors can gain in the first round, with any remaining shares offered on an FCFS (First Come, First Serve) basis in the second round between BSCPad users. Platform’s native token, $BSCPad, is used to operate. Has greater the Tier and allocation granted to a user, the more tokens they stake. 2. TrustSwap: TrustSwap is a BSC Network-based decentralized launchpad and protocol. The platform’s native currency, $SWAP, provides next-generation multi-chain swaps and answers to existing payment and subscription splitting difficulties. Staking, Smart Locks, and Smart Swaps are all possible with $SWAP. At a later stage, it allows the token to wrap inside an ERC20 token. TrustSwap was developed in Canada in the mid-2020s to mainstream smart contracts and enable “customizable transactions” in decentralized finance (Defi) and the crypto industry. 3. KuCoin Spotlight: KuCoin is a popular cryptocurrency exchange with its token launch platform, KuCoin Spotlight. Kucoin is a Chinese digital asset exchange. Since its launch in 2013, the company has become one of its most significant stock exchanges. Kucoin allows users to exchange digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc. Kucoin Spotlight is a unique feature on the exchange that will enable customers to receive rewards for exchanging specific digital assets. Kucoin is an excellent choice for people searching for a secure and easy-to-use digital asset exchange. KuCoin Spotlight highlighted Celer Network, Harmony, and Perlin. 4. Gate.io: Another outstanding crypto launchpad is Gate.io Launchpad. The Gate.io Launchpad allows blockchain companies to raise funds, get awareness, and build a following by selling tokens. The platform selects participants for token sales based on a first-come, first-served basis. Fetch.AI, Harmony, and Celer Network are some of the ICOs launched on Gate.io Launchpad. 5. Huobi Prime: Huobi is a leading global cryptocurrency exchange with a top crypto launchpad called Huobi Prime. In March 2019, Huobi Global launched Huobi Prime, a crypto trading platform that allows users to buy and sell select digital assets at discounted prices. The launch of Huobi Prime comes as the latest step in the company’s efforts to expand its presence in cryptocurrency and offer more services to its users. Huobi Prime has helped launch many successful ICOs, including TOP Network, BitTorrent Token, and Harmony. Final Thoughts: Launchpads have gained mainstream traction recently, helping entrepreneurs and crypto investors. Crypto launchpads connect interested investors with tokenized companies before they become public, allowing them to get a good deal on each token. A vetting process, which leading launchpads employ, also prohibits the launch of a rug-pull or ventures with no inherent value, giving their community of investors peace of mind. Before investing in any platform, do your research and due diligence, as there are numerous variables to consider when selecting an IDO crypto Launchpad.

"Whether Metaverse and Blockchain are Sides of One Coin?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-metaverse/","Blog Post","30/04/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Metaverse is a new digital platform connecting users through a shared metaverse, or online 3D world, using Blockchain and digital identification technology. Metaverse uses the power of Blockchain to connect individuals in a digital arena, allowing them to construct, interact, and transact in a more efficient, secure, and cost-effective manner. Metaverse aspires to establish a digital environment that is open, inclusive, and fair, where anybody may express themselves, make relationships, and produce value. Metaverse offers a new generation of online services and experiences, thanks to its technical base of Blockchain, digital identity, and virtual reality. What is Metaverse? The term “meta” alludes to “beyond,” while “verse” refers to the “universe.” Furthermore, some individuals use the term metaverse to refer to virtual worlds in which players can travel and interact with one another; for example, a world where developers can create buildings, parks, signs, and other items that do not exist in reality. It has massive hovering overhead light shows and well-known neighborhoods (where the rules of three-dimensional spacetime are ignored, and free-combat zones where people can go hunting and kill each other). Why has the popularity of metaverse increased? During the COVID-19 outbreak, people’s lifestyles changed dramatically, and students began taking online classes and working from home. This shift in the working environment necessitated ways to provide real-world experience while working or learning at home. Facebook changed its name to Meta in October 2021 to reflect its goal of creating a virtual world, or metaverse. Blockchain and Metaverse Interrelation The metaverse is a broad idea, and blockchain technology, like other new technologies, is expected to play a role. It is a collection of several technologies like machine learning, AI, VR, and Blockchain that have been brought together to work harmoniously and revolutionize how we interact with the internet.The metaverse is a three-dimensional virtual reality realm where users can interact with digital objects and each other in a fully immersive environment. The metaverse is infinite, continuous, real-time, self-contained, interoperable, and decentralized. It’s easy to see how cryptocurrencies could help the metaverse achieve its goal. Cryptocurrency has no relation to real-world fiat money in terms of value or physical form. As a result, it is a convenient way of payment and transaction in the virtual world. Furthermore, the metaverse is decentralized by definition. No one should not govern the metaverse, and decentralizing its currency would go a long way toward achieving this goal. Additionally, cryptocurrency (and blockchain technology in general) may be a valuable anchor in an ever-changing world. In the metaverse, our surroundings, natural habitats, people’s appearances, products, and so on would vary based on developer activity and ongoing customization. Blockchain and cryptocurrency’s immutability would give critical stability. At the same time, we cannot overlook that decentralization is a crucial factor in the metaverse. With the adoption of blockchain technology, users can safeguard their digital assets in VR. This point is highlighted in the blockchain projects like “The Sandbox” and Axie Infinity as they are connected with metaverse. Other features of blockchain technology like the value of the transfer, digital collectability, digital proof of ownership, accessibility, governance, and interoperability are also necessary for the effective execution of the metaverse. These blockchain features provide a cost-effective and transparent alternative for the users. Cross-chain compatibility of the Blockchain is working as a foundation stone for the metaverse. With cross-chain compatibility blockchains, the users can use their cryptographic tokens, both fungible and non-fungible tokens, between blockchains. Final Thoughts: Even though Blockchain is not necessary for a metaverse environment, it adds value to the metaverse. Blockchain adds value to the metaverse. It will be fascinating to see how the metaverse will develop in the future. Stay tuned and comment on your views on the box below for more exciting stories.

"Why is IDO Considered a Better Fundraising Option?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-ido/","Blog Post","27/04/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","An initial DEX offering or IDO is an innovative decentralized and permissionless crowdfunding platform revolutionizing the cryptocurrency world. When a project launches an IDO, it indicates launching a coin or token through a decentralized liquidity exchange. The cryptocurrency asset exchange uses liquidity pools to allow traders to trade tokens such as stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. An excellent example of liquidity paid is USDT/ETH. On the other hand, the ICO or initial coin offering was the first method of crypto funding. In 2017, it created controversy in the crypto space. What is an ICO? An initial coin offering (ICO) is a way of raising funds from individual investors which are not regulated by any authority. The lack of control and investor protections were the two most significant issues with ICOs. Project teams were not subjected to due diligence because there were no control measures. Almost any ICO project could guarantee significant returns, and many did. Several initial coin offering (ICO) ideas turned out to be either hasty money grabs or outright scams. They also tarnished the cryptocurrency business, discouraging many new investors from jumping on board. An initial DEX offering (IDO) is fundraising where investors invest their money. To overcome the flaws in the conventional ICO, the IDO is introduced to the crowdfunding paradigm. DEXs are decentralized liquidity exchanges because they work with an IDO rather than a centralized exchange. IDOs are the most recent approach for crypto companies seeking funding from investors. However, they are not without flaws. DEXs, for example, are less scalable. With this decentralized fundraising strategy, IDOs aim to address the flaws of ICOs while expanding the crypto market’s possibilities. Entrepreneurs can create a blockchain product immune to malevolent third-party influencers, hackers, and human mistakes by crowdfunding with IDOs. Moreover, IDO tokens are transferred and secured in the investor’s wallet with their private keys. How does IDO work? IDOs function as DEXs and can give immediate token liquidity. These liquidity pool providers are repeatedly rewarded fees by DEXs. Due to these liquidity pool providers, DEXs can run without interruptions for their users. Most projects contribute liquidity to the DEX by allocating a portion of their funds to help with trade. This strategy has become a standard process. A proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism is used in many applications to keep networks safe. This technique restricts the investors from selling too quickly. The PoS consensus requires that investors keep their money in their wallets in the supported cryptocurrency. Investors receive benefits in exchange for their “stake” in the network. Investors can start trading the project token the project launches. Early investors can sell their tokens for a higher price and purchase a large bag of tokens at a discounted price. The token value rises after the public sale is launched. The price will continue to grow as soon as the first sale occurs. Gas fees for executing a new smart contract are negligible on a liquid exchange since trade pairs have lots of liquidity. Smart contracts manage the asset token and liquidity pool. IDOs, unlike traditional fundraising strategies, can issue tokens immediately. However, a lack of proper process has resulted in many low-quality projects that can sometimes be frauds, with project owners stealing investors’ money and disappearing. Investors are not required to wait to list their preferred tokens on an exchange for long periods. The listing usually happens right after the IDO is finished. Compared to ICOs, this timing allows investors to cash in on their capital considerably faster. Steps Involved in IDO: Step 1: Plan a Business Strategy: Projects should create a plan for issuing the token offering on a DEX. The plan should contain how the project will solve the problems, fund allocation, the blockchain adopted for the project, a general marketing strategy, and how to lead the project after the IDO and keep the momentum going. Step 2:’s Prepare Marketing collateral: A website and a white paper are required marketing collateral for an IDO launch at first. A well-branded and attractive website helps in boosting investor confidence. A smart website can enable investors who have already logically invested in the project to push the emotional levers. The website gives the project a professional appearance and helps build a brand image. On the other hand, a superb white paper showcase specialties of the project with additional data to enhance the investors’ experience. A white paper’s objective is to sell through education, so there is no hard-sell copy in the document itself. On the other hand, the white paper includes statistical data, illustrations, tables, and other visual aids. The white paper employs statistics to persuade investors that the project is a good investment. Step 3: Decide the Launchpad: If a project fulfills the platform’s terms and conditions like whitelisting, consensus, etc., IDO is approved for launch. Step 4: Develop the cryptocurrency: Users can use an app like CoinTool and develop cryptocurrency using software. It has simplified the procedure for creating a coin. The challenge is to convince the investors to invest their funds in the project by projecting its actual worth and utility.The DEX lists the token for trading after completing the IDO and Token Generation Event (TGE). An automated market maker (AMM) such as Sushiswap or PancakeSwap is used to list items. Step 5: Token launch for fundraising: Investors will receive their tokens immediately after the IDO. The issuer can run an auction instead of setting a fixed price, resulting in a price determined by supply and demand. Investors may attract to contribute liquidity to the project, gaining and maintaining momentum. On the other hand, users can earn even more tokens by providing liquidity. Final Thoughts: The future of IDOs is promising, but investors should analyze the project’s worthiness before investing. Thank You! Related","[Cryptocurrency]","NULL"
"Why We Need Blockchain Bridge? Features with Overview","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-blockchain-bridge-and-its-benefits/","Blog Post","24/04/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","The most common issue blockchain users face is the inability to work together. Blockchain bridge or cross-chain bridge is adapted to connect the two blockchains. It helps the users to do transactions between two different blockchain networks. Blockchain technology revolves around the concept of decentralization. This feature ensures that several stakeholders can own and operate the network, which is impossible with the conventional and centralized governance model. It will also affect the wide range of services, like with Defi, it will increase the liquidity and communication across communities. Role of Blockchain Bridge: The term blockchain bridge can be described as a connection between two chains that allow the transfer of arbitrary data and tokens. This bridge is compatible with the two bridges’ different rules, protocols, and governance models and ensures secure interoperations for both blockchains. Blockchain bridges help perform many functions like smart contract conversion, data transfer, token transfer, etc. For example, Ethereum and Bitcoin are two popular and major cryptocurrency networks. Both these networks have different sets of protocols. With the help of the blockchain bridge, the Ethereum network permits bitcoin users to transfer their coins, buy Ethereum tokens, low-fee payments, etc. In this transaction, the blockchain bridge holds the bitcoins and creates an equivalent amount of ETH for the sender. There is no actual transfer of cryptos from one protocol to another. A smart contract locks the number of bitcoins and gives access to an equivalent amount of ETH. The reverse process happens when the investor converts back its bitcoins. The remaining ETH gets burned, and an equivalent amount of bitcoins is returned to the wallet. Blockchain Bridges: Trust-Based Vs. Trustless Centralization is one of the implicit drawbacks of the blockchain bridges, as users give control to their coins if they want to convert to other cryptos. Even though Trust-based blockchain bridges are an economical and faster option for transferring a large pool of cryptocurrency, the availability of reliable services is minimal. Using less-known brands can increase the associated risk. Whereas Trustless or decentralized blockchain bridges are safe options for the users. These bridges act as a blockchain with separate networks to validate transactions. In this case, the trust is based on the mathematical calculations built in the code. Many computer codes work simultaneously to reach a common agreement. Benefits of the Blockchain Bridge: 1. Interoperability is a significant advantage of the blockchain bridge. Other benefits are as follows. 2. Improvement in Scalability: Sometimes, it becomes difficult to handle many transactions. The number is increasing rapidly with applications to register on blocks for large blockchain networks. This transaction volume might result in delays and ultimately hinder operations. With the adoption of some sidechains, blockchain bridges can lower the pressure on the single blockchain platform as users can transfer the tokens from one blockchain to another. For Example, PolyBridge is a blockchain bridge developed by Poly-Network that supports Ethereum, Ontology, Neo, Bitcoin, Zilliqa, Binance Smart Chain, Huobi ECO Chain, Elrond, Bitcoin. Dapps built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) can transact with ERC 20 tokens using this bridge. 3. Faster Instant Payments: Interoperability can increase the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. Only some stores accept payment in Bitcoin. With the adoption of bridges, the users can make instant payments in Bitcoin at the point of sale. 4. Beneficial for smaller blockchains: Blockchain bridge is helpful for the growth of the small blockchains. With the use of bridges, the users can transfer the tokens to comparatively unpopular networks that might have lower costs. For the development of the crypto ecosystem, blockchain bridges are beneficial. Popular Blockchain Bridges: 1. AnySwap: AnySwap is a blockchain-based, peer-to-peer, global trade platform that provides instant and secure trading of cryptocurrencies. The platform uses a unique mechanism called the AnySwap system, which allows traders to exchange one cryptocurrency for another of their choice, with the option to trade instantly at the current market price. The system is powered by the AnySwap network, a decentralized exchange that uses the Swap Token as a medium of exchange to allow traders to trade from anywhere. The Swap Token is an ERC20 token used to pay transaction fees on the AnySwap exchange and is also used to pay for the services provided by the AnyPay teams. 2. Binance Bridge: Binance Chain is a blockchain bridge that provides instant blockchain service worldwide. By using Binance Chain, users can access a wide range of blockchain-based services, such as decentralized exchanges, cross-chain decentralized payments, and more, on a single network. Binance Chain is designed to enable a wide variety of developers to build services on it, unlocking up a spectrum of possibilities for the future of blockchain. Binance Chain is also a decentralized exchange (DEX), meaning it doesn’t require any third party to operate. 3. CBridge: C Bridge is a blockchain bridge connecting the world of cryptocurrencies and traditional finance. It is an open-source, decentralized protocol and network built on the NEO platform to provide a unique digital asset transaction platform. It offers several features, including decentralized exchange, payment platform, and oracle services. C Bridge is developed to bridge the gap between the digital world of cryptocurrencies and traditional finance’s digital asset exchange and trading systems. Conclusion: Decentralization has always been a critical feature of blockchain. Therefore, it takes precedence over other operational enhancements like scalability. Naturally, developers are wary of significant modifications, fearing that they would stray from the decentralizing principle. Bridges built on the blockchain show that they’ve moved past that mindset. We may be making headway toward a more creative and normalized crypto economy, but any development is preferable to remaining stuck in the status quo.

"Metaverse Finance (MetaFi): Emerging Trend In Finance Sector","https://blockchainshiksha.com/learn-about-metaverse-finance/","Blog Post","21/04/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Isn’t it true that everyone is talking about Defi, Metaverse finance (MetaFi), and the metaverse? Are these terms interchangeable? Why are experts so enthralled by these technologies? This post will throw some light on the subject and discuss essential points. So, let’s get started. Since 2018, Decentralized Finance (Defi) has been the talk of the crypto world for various reasons. Defi is based on permissionless innovation, a goal for greater financial inclusion, and principles governing wealth sovereignty. At the same time, the metaverse, a new type of technical innovation, has evolved. Now the combination of these two technologies is coming up. In the form of MetaFi, which is fascinating to the crypto community. Even though in its early stages now, Defi has gained the attention of the mainstream. Only 5% of total crypto assets are used as collateral in various Defi platforms. It will be interesting to see how the connection between MetaFi and Defi evolves. Before discussing MetaFi, we need to understand some facts about the Defi. What is Defi? Decentralized finance (Defi) is the latest open finance management system with better transparency, interoperability, ease of composing, and programmability. Decentralized finance, or Defi, is a system that allows investors to trade financial products over a decentralized blockchain network. The transactions do not require using intermediaries such as banks or brokers. Defi accepts investors who do not have a government-issued ID, a brokerage or bank account, residence evidence, or a social security card. Defi is limited to only a few use cases like lending and borrowing. But it has the potential to expand its inclusion in a wide range of applications with metaverse. Introduction to Metaverse Finance (MetaFi) Metaverse Fi or MetaFi involves the services, products, and protocols designed for complex financial transactions between fungible tokens, derivatives, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Crypto space is one of the crucial aspects of the metaverse that eases the creator economy in the metaverse. As per the industry experts, the metaverse will surpass the real-world economies by a significant margin in the coming years. Two layers of the metaverse will impact the functionalities of MetaFi crypto. Each layer of the metaverse, namely the interface layer and financial computation task, has its distinct functionality. Various software and hardware determine the end-user experience in the interface layer. On the other hand, metaverse computation tasks are handled with a financial compute layer, a democratic, decentralized, and transparent foundation for defining logic for the creator economy. As per the industry experts, a significant development in the metafi is expected with the establishment of decentralized ledgers and a parallel economic system. Metafi will offer global accessibility in the crypto space with transparency. Many new trends in digital-first economics are coming in the form of Play-to-Earn games and NFTs. Why is MetaFi gaining popularity? Let us now discuss the driving force for the popularity of the metafi. 1. MetaFi has the potential to capture the flow of digital assets and value in the open free market. It establishes new ways of the real-time discovery price, thereby determining the unlocking of hidden value. 2. Crypto developers use the complexity of the device. At the same time, NFT platforms are establishing the economic terms for communities and creators that they can exchange with users. NFT creators can earn perpetual tokens with their personalized social tokens 3. In adopting the Metafi, matured governance models like DAO are playing a crucial role. In combination with DAOs, Defi has introduced community-based insurance for the users. 4. The introduction of the Play-to-earn games and innovative ways of data monetization can introduce the Metafi-based applications in the long run. Challenges for MetaFi The development of the metaverse is still in the development stage. Even though many advantages are visible in combining the Defi and metaverse, some prominent challengers exist. 1. The NFT creators must have precise predictions for the value of their NFTs for selling, purchasing, and borrowing against their NFTs. Usually, the NFT appraisals are the cause of uncertainty for lenders. 2. NFT factorization is different for the MetaFi crypto applications, which is another challenge to adopting MetaFi governance. 3. Another challenge before the MetaFi is the difference in standards across the blockchains, creating a hurdle in combining metaverse and Defi. Final Thoughts: In 2020, the device gained a lot of popularity, but it is still adopted in limited use cases, particularly in lending and borrowing applications. In contrast, the metaverse is a digital revolution in the real world. It will be interesting to watch how these two trends define and metaverse combine to create new products in the crypto ecosystem.

"Best Coins for Crypto Staking to Earn Passive Income","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-crypto-staking/","Blog Post","16/04/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Staking is one of the most effective techniques to earn money from cryptocurrencies passively. Rather than simply holding the coins, investors can invest them in pools and make significant returns. Investors can stake cryptocurrency on all cryptocurrencies that use the Proof-of-Stake consensus method. Even though staking is beneficial, investors must conduct their homework to get the most out of it. This post will examine how to stake cryptocurrency, precautions before staking, and which cryptocurrencies enable staking. What is Crypto Staking? Staking is the way of locking funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to improve the safety and procedures of a blockchain network in exchange for rewards. Investors can immediately stake their cryptos into a Trust wallet most of the time. On the other hand, some exchanges offer to stake services to their customers. Blockchain networks calculate the staking incentive in a variety of methods. Some networks, for example, compute on a block-by-block basis, considering account parameters like how long the validator has been actively staking, the number of coins staked, the inflation rate, and the overall number of coins staked on the network, and so on. On the other hand, Validators may receive a fixed proportion of the network’s reward as compensation for causing network volatility. Validators can compute the reward they will receive in this model. But, staking is possible in the case of only those cryptos with a Proof of stake consensus mechanism. The Proof-of-Stake mechanism is more energy efficient than the traditional Proof-of-Work mechanism. Ways in which staking could be done 1. Through Crypto Exchange: Users of major centralized crypto exchanges can stake coins in exchange for rewards. These platforms invest in cryptocurrency on their consumers’ behalf. Most exchanges levy a commission on customers’ staking rewards while offering significant payouts. Users can stake cryptocurrencies on platforms like Binance and Coinbase and receive rewards in exchange. Staking cryptocurrencies like AXS, SHIB, AVAX, NEAR, LUNA, ADA, and MATIC delivers a high payout of up to 104.62 percent APY through Binance’s high-yield center function. 2. Staking with Pools: Investors that use exchanges to stake join “staking pools” run by other users and lock their cash in the pools to collect incentives. Investors can transfer and lock their funds for a set amount of time by connecting their crypto wallets to the validator’s pool. However, investors must verify these pools’ validity before transferring tokens. 3. Staking with Validator: Validators are members of the blockchain network who check transactions to ensure the network’s security. Validators validate transactions and stake coins. They will be compensated with crypto coins if they successfully validate a transaction. By becoming validators, investors can obtain staking incentives. Compared to the previous two techniques, becoming a validator to receive staking rewards is more complicated. Furthermore, being a validator necessitates a significant initial expenditure. Risk Factor Assessment in Staking 1. Coin Value: The valuation of a coin plays a critical role in long-term financial decisions. It is advisable to avoid investment in coins with a high inflation rate. Such coins earn high returns initially, but significantly fewer returns are risky. 2. Fixed Supply: It is necessary to check whether the coin has a fixed supply. In the crypto with a limited and steady coin supply, the chances of increasing price in response to the rise in demand are more. 3. Real-time Application: The coins used in more use cases generally maintain their demand in the market, thereby ensuring the constant price surge. Popular PoS cryptocurrencies for staking: 1. Solana: To the records of Statista, in March 2022, Solana is the most popular and staked cryptocurrency in terms of net staked value. Solana (SOL) is a blockchain-based platform with smart contracts designed to deploy applications (Dapps). SOL (crypto of Solana) is a stackable token useful in performing transactions and paying network fees. Users can participate in the network as delegated stakers or validators for earning staking rewards. Validators maintain the Solana network and process the transactions. Delegated stakers delegate their tokens to pool operators for staking for earning rewards. 2. Cardano (ADA): Cardano is a third-generation blockchain for smart contract building. Cardano’s native currency is ADA, a valuable token for incentivizing network security and transaction facilitation. Participants earn rewards by stake delegation and running a stake pool. With the help of the Emurgo’s Yoroi wallet or IOG’s Daedalus wallet, ADA holders can stake their tokens. The rewards are given to stake delegates at the end of each cycle. 3. Polkadot (DOT): Polkadot (DOT) is an interoperability blockchain protocol for connecting the different chains to the network. Users earn staking rewards as a nominator for a proof-of-stake (NPoS) consensus algorithm or as a validator. On the Polkadot network, validators are responsible for transaction validation, and nominators ensure the appropriate functioning of validators. Both nominators and validators can claim the staking rewards using Ledger or Polkadot JS wallet. 4. Ethereum 2.0 (ETH): Ethereum 2.0 is the upgrade to the Ethereum protocol and transition from PoW to PoS. It has made available mining of ETH holders. A vali9dator locks in a minimum of 32 ETH into a deposit contract address. In addition to minimum ETH accessing the network as a node and verifying transactions on the blockchain, specific software is required. 5. Terra (LUNA): Terra is a public blockchain and open-source protocol. This protocol enables users to establish stablecoins pegged with international fiat currencies like Korean wan (KRT), US dollar, and euro(EUT). Terra’s price is determined using an algorithm and Terra’s LUNA token. Final Thoughts: Many cryptocurrencies with POS can be used for staking. But it is essential to keep certain factors while choosing to stake to earn passive income. If you have any questions, please reach out to us.

"What is Web 3? Scam, Myth, or Future Around the Corner","https://blockchainshiksha.com/learn-about-web-3/","Blog Post","13/04/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","The future of the internet has been called Web 3, which is not a single platform like the Web we use today but rather a series of technologies that will form a more open and decentralized internet.The first step toward this new Web came with the invention of the blockchain, the technology that underlies cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Today, we’re seeing the next step in the evolution of the Web, with the creation of a new generation of decentralized services and apps that offer users unprecedented control over their data. Industry professionals have differing perspectives on web 3.0; some see it as a hoax, while others see it as the way of the future. We will discuss both of these views in this article. However, to comprehend the relevance of web 3, it is vital first to understand what web 1.0 and web 2.0 are. What is Web 1.0? The internet was initially introduced to the world in the late 1980s. Web 1.0 was limited to static read-only’ messages that only a few people could see. It was a significant technological advancement at the time. Unlike the current dynamic HTML, the websites serve static material. Organizations were storing the data and content in static file systems rather than databases, which was the main characteristic of web 1.0, a read-only web with no interactivity. What is Web 2.0? The social and interactive online is referred to as Web 2.0. It is a user-friendly internet, and anyone without being a member of the developer team can share their opinions with the world. It enables users to establish their distinct personas. Scope in social media platforms and e-commerce have evolved due to this upheaval, affecting societal structures worldwide. Cascading Style Sheets 3 (CSS3), Hypertext Markup Language 5 (HTML5), and JavaScript are examples of breakthrough web technologies developed by Web 2.0. Data breaches have often occurred in Web 2.0 apps. Users had no control over their data or how it was stored or hacked. Thanks to the centralized servers, the government can easily manage, intervene, or shut down applications that contradict its propaganda. In high inflation, volatility, or political turmoil, the government can get access to bank accounts and restrict access. Now, the globe is transitioning to a new phase of web 3.0, which comes with many unique benefits. What is Web 3.0 and its significance? Web 3.0 combines the advantages of previous versions with the power of IoT, AI, and blockchain. This version of the internet focuses on cutting-edge technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence and improved data security. Self-governance, verifiable, trustless, native built-in payments, distributed and robust systems, permissionless, and self-governing systems are all features of Web 3.0 over previous versions of the internet. Web 3.0 creates a crypto-economic protocol by deploying, building, and implementing its applications on a decentralized network of many servers or nodes, blockchains, or two servers. These programs are known as Dapps, or decentralized apps, in Web 3.0. Web 3.0 combines the advantages of previous versions with the power of IoT, AI, and blockchain.

This governance layer has established confidence between two unidentified players in the transaction, allowing them to reach an agreement. Web 3.0’s blockchain technology has ushered in a backend revolution. Why do some industry professionals think web 3.0 is a scam? Some industry professionals believe that web 3.0 may lead to more scams and fraudulent activity despite these advantages. Even though web 3.0 has a network of linked systems that creates a trustless environment, there are still a lot of expensive flaws, ineptitude, outright scams where scammers steal investor funds in a short amount of time, and so on. In web 3.0, the rule of supply and demand still applies. Poor people are willing to work for less money than wealthy persons with equal qualifications. Axie Infinity’s example best describes it. Its play-to-earn game has risen in popularity in the Philippines, resulting in a workforce. As a result, it has provided people with a new method to earn money by playing. Because the game is based on crypto tokens, there is a risk of instability and catastrophic loss, as was the case last year for players. The regulator’s role is critical in this issue. Crypto tokens, which are currently in the grey zone for regulators worldwide, are used in most Web 3.0 applications. According to Gary Gensler of the Securities and Exchange Commission, platforms that issue tokens should follow restrictions comparable to firms that issue stocks and bonds to investors. Final thoughts: Web 3.0 is still in its early stages as the internet evolves worldwide. Technology will grow, and new patterns will emerge. It would be fascinating to monitor fresh advances and launch new items. If you want to know more, please comment in the box below.

"Why is bitcoin investment a new way of inflation hedging?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/bitcoin-hedging-the-inflation/","Blog Post","08/04/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Crypto investment is creating a buzz on the investment horizon, and bitcoin is the most popular investment option in today’s era. Bitcoin is leading the market due to its significant capitalization, infrastructure, decentralized features, and longest track record. As per the revolution investment thesis, the value of bitcoin is not dependent on the factors like government or the valuation of fiat currency. Bitcoin is value storage irrespective of the geographic location of the holder. However, it can still be compared with macroeconomic parameters all over the globe, including in developed nations like the USA. The idea behind this strategy is that its value will rise dramatically due to the fixed supply of bitcoin. However, in case of a rise in the supply of fiat currency, inflation will also show an upward trend. In the Covid-19 pandemic situation, it is observed that most the western countries, including the U.S., have pumped new fiat currency into the economy and dispersed it. As a consequence, now these countries are witnessing inflation. Why does Bitcoin investment act as a hedge against inflation as a store of value? If a country witnesses inflation of 5% per year, the $1 price of a commodity X at the start of the fiscal year will be $1.05. More fiat money will need to purchase the same commodity. Fiat currency kept in bank accounts earns meager returns, which is insufficient to match inflation. If funds are kept as bitcoin, the value appreciated would compensate for the rise in the commodity. Before introducing bitcoin in the financial market, investors used to hold gold. Thus, we can conclude that holding bitcoin, in the long run, can solve the valuation issue that might arise due to inflation. While investment in bitcoin for short durations, consideration of factors like the risk profile of the investor, time horizon, and technical prowess is necessary. For individual clients, it is crucial to think about the bitcoin price volatility for a short-term duration. In today’s Russia – Ukraine war, cryptocurrency investment is emerging as a neutral alternative for receiving monetary aid in the circumstances of economic sanctions imposed on Russia. Investment in crypto: Bitcoin or Ethereum Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have gained popularity in the crypto space and contributed to this sector’s growth. The first cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, called digital gold or gold 2.0, whereas Ethereum introduced a decentralized ecosystem. Both have their uniqueness. BTC is the first crypto not regulated by any central authority, created in 2009. Since then, it has been the best-performing mainstream investment. BTC’s performance is expected to continue in the long run with the rise in awareness about bitcoin investment. It is easier for investors to understand the pros and cons of investment in bitcoin due to the accessible information available about BTC. Ethereum is the distributed blockchain network with native crypto ETH used for interaction and transactions with decentralized apps (Dapps) built on it. Dapps are the next-generation applications utilizing the advantages of blockchain. Leading global corporations like JP Morgan and Microsoft have started using Ethereum for their products, which will undoubtedly maintain Ethereum’s demand high in coming years. Due to the adoption of blockchain technology, Ether transactions cannot be tracked by centralized financial systems like banks. Thus, it makes the Ether transactions secure and anonymous. How is the Gaming industry changing with Web 3.0 and Blockchain? In 2021, the gaming industry generated revenue close to $160 billion. This revenue model denotes the gaming industry dynamics from free-to-play games to play-to-earn games. One of the root causes of this change in the gaming industry lies in adopting web 3.0, allowing players to earn while enjoying the game. Players can buy and sell the assets in or outside these games. Why is the popularity of the gaming industry increasing? The maximum number of games have in-app purchases, which earn almost 50% of the revenue. With the adoption of blockchain technology, the ownership of in-game assets is secured, and web 3.0 ensures the finite supply of these assets in the ecosystem. On purchasing this in-game asset, asset ownership lies with the player and not with the game, thereby protecting the money and time of the players. Another benefit is that players can monetize their gaming skills using web 3.0. The earning depends on the expertise of the players while playing. The players make their win in the form of crypto, which they can exchange for other crypto-assets or fiat currency. Blockchain-based games are interoperable, and users can switch between the games easily using their digital assets. Various digital assets are available, like NFTs in avatars, skins, and weapons that can be used in other games.

"What makes Ethereum Virtual Machine the most popular VM?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-evm/","Blog Post","03/04/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","As we are now using next-gen internet web 3.0, the need for interoperability and connection between two or more blockchain ecosystems is also increasing. In this case, virtual machines come into the picture, and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the most widely used VM. What is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)? EVM is a programmable, open-source, decentralized public blockchain. It stores millions of executable projects and runs and executes smart contract deployment. The transactions on EVM are clustered in the blocks in a decentralized ecosystem. The consensus algorithm is applied for transaction validation. The EVM uses proof-of-work consensus, meaning participating nodes must solve an arbitrary mathematical puzzle. All nodes on the EVM ensure the POW is achieved for transaction validation. Ethereum Virtual Machine is a Turing complete, which means it can solve complex computational problems if appropriate instructions, memory, and time are allocated. EVM uses the Ethereum protocol that ensures the execution of every code in a trustless ecosystem, and the outcome is guaranteed for smart contract execution. The system keeps a track record of execution costs for all the instructions on the EVM. The execution cost is recorded in terms of the Gas units. At the beginning of transaction execution, Ether is reserved for gas fees. With this Gas reserve mechanism, the validator is ensured about pre-paid gas amount even if the transaction does not execute. At the transaction execution time, the validator will ensure that there is valid transaction information and enough funds are available for the transaction.Thousands of applications can run on EVM as its nodes work in a decentralized manner without any need for them to have their blockchain. Data Storage in Ethereum The data storage on Ethereum resembles bank record-keeping. The data is stored in a trie (tree-like) structure. Complete information is not recorded in the blocks of the Ethereum blockchain, and only hashes of the transactions are stored in the node. Two different data types exist in Ethereum, namely permanent data and ephemeral data. 1. Permanent Data: EVM transactions are permanent transactions that can not be altered once confirmed. This data is stored in a trie (tree-like structure) 2. Ephemeral Data: The example of Ephemeral data is the account balance. This data changes with the progress of the transactions. Benefits of EVM: 1. Easy to build Dapps on EVM: It is an effortless task for the developers to build Dapps on the EVM due to its interoperability feature. 2. Many benefits of smart contracts: One famous example is the smart contract for NFT, which enables the creation of digital art and its sale on a decentralized platform. Downsides of EVM: 1. Not entirely decentralized: Many Ethereum nodes use centralized cloud servers. If these agencies discontinue the EVM, it could damage the network. 2. Huge gas fees at the time of network congestion: Due to a rise in the load on the blockchain, it may result in network congestion, leading to an increase in the gas fees. This incidence is the biggest downside for the transacting parties. Final Thoughts: EVM is the most popular and adopted blockchain platform regarding interoperability and technological prowess. In the following article, we will discuss more exciting information about EVM. Please feel free to comment on the box below if you have questions.

"What is the Interrelation between Web3 and Blockchain Tech?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-web3/","Blog Post","01/04/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Web3 and Blockchain tech are the buzzwords these days. What does the term Web 3.0 mean? What is the role of blockchain technology in Web 3.0? Let us discuss. The internet has become an integral part of life all over the world. No one can imagine life without internet applications in day-to-day life. Still today, users have a threat of data security with the existing web. This global pandemic has highlighted the significance of internet and data security during the crisis. Web 3.0 has strengthened after introducing blockchain technology into the internet’s universe. Now we will see how the blockchain has the potential to drive the development of web 3. It is essential to find out the earlier two variations of web 3.0, i.e., web 1.0 and web 2.0 What is Web 1.0? In the late 1980s, the world witnessed the first arrival of the internet. Web 1.0 was restricted to static ‘read-only’ messages covering only a few participants. It was a major technological upliftment of its time. The websites were serving static content, unlike the latest dynamic HTML. Static file systems were used for the data and content instead of a database which is the main characteristic of web 1.0 was the read-only web, with no interaction. What is Web 2.0? Web 2.0 is characterized as the social and interactive web. It is a user-friendly internet, and anyone can share their thoughts with the world without being part of the creator team. It allows users to create their unique personal identities. Because of this revolution, opportunities in social media platforms and e-commerce have emerged and affected social structures worldwide. Web 2.0 has developed revolutionary web technologies like Cascading Style Sheets 3 (CSS3), Hypertext Markup Language 5 (HTML5), and JavaScript. Web 2.0 applications have experienced repeated data breaches. There was no control over users’ data and how it was stored and hacked. Because of the centralized servers, the government can easily control, intervene or shut down applications against their propaganda. The government can access bank accounts and limit access in case of extreme inflation, volatility, and political unrest. Now the world is moving towards a new phase of web 3.0 with many added advantages. What is Web3? Web3 is the addition of its earlier versions with the power of IoT, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. This version of the internet is focused on innovative technologies like machine learning and AI, along with better data security. Web 3.0 has additional characteristics over earlier versions of the internet: self-governance, verifiable, trustless, native built-in payments, distributed and robust system, permissionless, and self-governing systems. Web 3.0 deploys, builds and implements its applications on a decentralized network of many servers or nodes, blockchains, or two servers to create a crypto-economic protocol. In Web 3.0, these applications are termed Dapps or decentralized apps. One more important part of Web 3.0 is cryptocurrency. These protocols give a financial incentive as a token for participants willing to create, govern, contribute, or improve their projects. Importance of Blockchain on Web 3.0 The significance of Web 3.0 can be found with the introduction of Alexa and Siri voice assistants. These services show how machine learning develops a new path for internet services. Along with adopting the internet of things (IoT), Web 3.0 also uses decentralized protocols and covers many aspects like automation with smart contacts, censorship-resistant storage for P2P data files, interoperability, seamless integration, etc. It means the driving force behind Web 3.0 would be blockchain technology. Web infrastructures like Livepeer, Filecoin, The Graph, Arweave, etc., have issued tokens that govern how these protocols function. The participants also receive rewards at many levels of the network. Native blockchain proto like Ethereum have the same manner of operation. Another advantage of Web 3.0 is that it has strongly supported developing the governance layer on the existing internet. This governance layer has created trust between two unknown parties in the transaction to agree. Blockchain technology in Web 3.0 has developed a backend revolution. Final Thoughts: The basic observation is that blockchain technology would be an integral part of Web 3.0. This trend would transform traditional enterprise processes with its pre-established traits. Issues identified in Web 2.0, like data integrity and centralized systems, are solved in this internet variation.© Thank You! Related","[Blockchain, Metaverse and Web3]","NULL"
"What is the Importance of Decentralized apps (Dapps) Today?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-are-dapps/","Blog Post","25/03/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","After introducing smartphones and other gadgets, almost everyone is familiar with the term apps. People use phone apps for various purposes like games, social media like Instagram and Snapchat, entertainment like YouTube, etc. User’s all needs could be satisfied with mobile apps. Nowadays, a new form of an app is gaining popularity, Dapps. What are Dapps (decentralized Apps)? A decentralized app uses blockchain technology and has fundamental differences from web apps. Regular apps run on centralized servers belonging to that company. In contrast, decentralized apps (Dapps) are developed on blockchain technology. It has decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. The most important advantage of the blockchain is that it is a distributed ledger. IT means every participant of the blockchain has a copy of the transaction. No single computer or organization has exclusive access to the data stored on the blockchain network.The data blocks on the blockchain are immutable, which means it is impossible to change the data stored. Because of this feature, blockchain is more secure and enhances transparency, as it does not hide information. Categories of Dapps: Even though Dapps manage and generate tokens, they don’t have to be transaction apps like Bitcoin. Tokens generated by these Dapps are used as a reward system for encouraging nodes to add value to the app. Type 1 Dapps: DApps: Dapps, with their blockchain system, fall under type 1. A famous example is Bitcoin and Litecoin blockchains. We can compare their functionality with operating systems like MAC OS, Windows, etc. Type 2 Dapps: Type 2 DApps use the underlying blockchain of kind one apps. They have their tokens and necessary protocols for their functioning. The best example of type 2 DApps is Omni Protocol, a distributed trading platform based on the Bitcoin blockchain. It ensures trustless, peerless, and effortless exchange of assets or value between transacting parties. Type 3 Dapps: Type 3 DApps are based on the protocol of type 2 applications. The best example of Type 3 Dapps is SAFE NETWORK (Secure Access For Everyone). It is a communication and data storage network that replaces data servers and centers with more facilities for users. Features of Decentralized apps 1. Open-Source: Dapps are open-source, meaning the codebase is freely available. For changes in the working or structure of the app, most participants’ approval is necessary. 2. Decentralized: These DApps adopt a public and decentralized blockchain that stores all the information and operations of the app. This technique ensures transparency and security. 3. Protocol: Protocol is used to show proof of value, ensuring the value of a particular process. It can verify the authenticity of a specific technique. 4. Incentive: Dapps offer some cryptographic tokens to the users as an incentive. These tokens are liquid assets and work as an incentive for supporting the blockchain Dapps ecosystem. 5. Scalable: As the Dapps are decentralized, blockchain-based applications, it offers peer-to-peer validation. 6. Availability: As Dapps have a peer-to-peer network, they cannot die or crash entirely from the system. Dapps are always available for the participants. 7. Secured: Because of the adoption of blockchain, smart contracts, and Proof-of-Work mechanisms, Dapps are reliable, trustworthy, and impossible to hack. Top Platforms for Dapps Even though there as many platforms available for Dapps, the most popular blockchain platforms are Ethereum, EOS, and Tron. Let us discuss these platforms briefly. 1.Ethereum: ETH or Ethereum is famous for ensuring true decentralization and security. But, in terms of scalability (transaction processing ability at scale), Ethereum is not a good option. For many blockchain projects, including over 2500 Dapps, Ethereum has been adopted. ETH is the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, a version of Bitcoin. Even though it is expensive, it is the best option for developing Dapps. 2.EOS: EOS has 21 witnesses or validators for verifying the transactions based on Proof Of Stake consensus. They pay the validators for securing the network with voting. With EOS for scalability, rational decentralization is applied. 3.TRON: Like EOS, TRON also uses the Delegated Proof of Stake consensus algorithm. TRON is a new blockchain platform than Ethereum but has the potential to take the place of Ethereum. For gambling sites and gaming applications, TRON is a famous blockchain platform. Around 1500 Dapps are developed on TRON. Final Thoughts: After the emergence of blockchain technology and continuous inventions, Dapps are gaining popularity. Dapps offer more transparency and security than web apps. The scope for Dapps is expected to grow in the future once blockchain technology becomes the first choice for techies the following articles, we will explore more about Dapps.

"What is Yield Farming? Is it a Better Option to Earn Passive Income?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-defi-and-yield-farming/","Blog Post","19/03/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Over the last few years, yield farming in decentralized finance has gained popularity worldwide. If you are a crypto investor, you must have heard this term. In this article, let us briefly discuss the concept of decentralized finance, yield farming, and how it works. What is Defi and Yield Farming? Decentralized finance or Defi refers to a system where investors can transact with financial products on a decentralized blockchain network. There is no need for mediators like banks or brokers to execute the transactions. Investors without government-issued ID, brokerage or bank account, address proof, or social security card can invest in Defi. What is yield farming? Yield farming provides liquidity to Defi. They provide liquidity in return for the yield. In this process, the crypto holders deposit their cryptos into a lending protocol in return for interest. Some protocol’s governance tokens also reward the additional yields. Working on yield is like bank loans. Like a bank, the loan borrower repays the loan and interest, and the bank earns interest. Instead of banks, the crypto holder is the lender and earns returns from lending idle protocols with yield farming. Idle cryptos in an exchange or hot wallet create liquidity in Defi protocols. We will see phrases like liquid providers, liquidity pools, and automated market maker models associated with yield farming. 1. A liquidity provider is a crypto holder with idle cryptos who deposits them in the smart contract. The Defi market is empowered with a smart contract and cash liquidity pool. 2. An automated market maker (AMM) is used to execute yield farming. On decentralized exchanges, this model is gaining popularity. Traditional order books on the crypto exchanges contain all buy and sell orders. An AMM generates a liquidity pool with smart contracts instead of determining the price of assets available for trade. Predetermined algorithms execute the trades in these pools. For most crypto exchanges, these liquidity pools play a crucial role as it helps the investors to lend, borrow, and swap tokens. Borrowers get liquidity to funds locked in cryptocurrencies. AMM serves the contract for matching participants. Borrowers get the funds for predetermined interest rates between the transacting parties. Popular Defi-related stablecoins are DAI, BUSD, USDC, USDT, etc. How are the yield farming returns calculated? Annualized model is used for calculating the estimated yield returns. It denotes the estimated earnings for locking up cryptos for a year. Popular metrics for calculating the yield are annual percentage rate (APR) and annual percentage yield (APY). The fundamental difference between these two methods is that APR does not use compound interest, including plowing back profits to increase profits. It isn’t easy to calculate the returns as it is a dynamic market. Market experts based calculation models on the estimates. Farmers always consider fluctuations in the profitability as on some days; they may earn huge returns while on some sessions, they might incur a loss. The market risk is for both lenders and borrowers. Let us take the example of a popular yield farming optimizer protocol: Yearn Finance yEarn or Yield finance gained popularity last year because it gave the highest yields on top altcoins, ETH deposits, and stablecoins. The user token converts yTokens (yUSDT, yDAI, yUSDC). The smart contract protocol searches into Defi protocols with the highest yield for farming and executes the transaction. But, before deciding to yield farming, it is always advisable to understand the associated risks. Risks in yield farming. 1. Smart contract risk: Smart contracts are written in paperless digital codes and contain predetermined contract terms between parties. These contracts execute the trade automatically. But bugs and vectors can attack smart contracts in the code. Because of such attacks, popular Defi protocols, Akropolis, and Uniswap users have incurred losses because of smart contract scams. 2. Liquidation Risks: As the crypto market is dynamic, the risk might arise when the value of collateral deposits drops below the loan amount. If you take the loan against the collateralized ETH, and the value of ETH drops, this stage would liquidate the value of the collateral. 3. Impermanent loss risk: In the case of yield farming, liquidity providers put funds into pools for earning profits from decentralized exchanges (DEXs). In this process, liquidity providers risk loss during sharp market moves. If AMM does not update token prices on a real-time basis with movements in the market, then LPs would cover the difference. They might incur a loss if a price drops. LPs could not earn profits if the price rose as they locked their funds in the pool. Final Thoughts: If you do not have experience in crypto transactions and overall market trends, you shouldn’t do yield farming. In one downward swoop, you might lose your entire earnings. It is a fast-paced and volatile process. If you have further queries, please comment on the box below. Team Blockchain Shiksha would be happy to help you. Thank You! Post navigation Related 1.

"Do you know What Penetration Testing is in the Blockchain?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-penetration-testing/","Blog Post","12/03/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","In every industry, the adoption of blockchain technology is increasing manifold. It is applied in a wide range of use cases. Its popularity mainly lies in the data security backed by immutable smart contracts. Various techniques like blockchain penetration testing are used in the security assessment process. In this blog, we will explore more about Penetration testing. In recent years, organizations have used blockchain technology for managing digital transactions, distributed databases, healthcare, and cybersecurity to provide customized blockchain-based solutions. Principles of decentralization, cryptography, and consensus are applied to secure the transactions stored using the blockchain. Along with many advantages of this technology, it has attracted the cybercriminal’s attention to target organizations with attacks and data hacking. In a nutshell, performing a comprehensive risk assessment procedure for enduring blockchain security is essential. This security can be achieved by implementing security testing methodologies, cybersecurity frameworks, and secure coding practices. It protects blockchain solutions from breaches and cyberattacks. Table of Contents • Blockchain Penetration Testing • Three Types of Penetration Testing • Advantages of Penetration Testing Blockchain Penetration Testing: Ethical hackers or security professionals perform blockchain penetration testing, a security assessment process. These professionals check the security arrangement for blockchain-based applications or solutions. Penetration testing involves three stages. In the first stage, information is collected for understanding and analyzing functional and business requirements. A threat model is prepared, which includes the following tasks. Analyzing the blockchain architecture Determining threat entry points Collecting available data of potential threats Built smart contract business logic Formulate targets for conducting security testing Preparing design for test strategy Test Environment Set up In the #second phase of the Penetration test, functional testing is performed for the blockchain to evaluate its development level estimated against industry guidelines and practices. The activities included in this phase are functional testing, API security testing, Network Vulnerability assessment, documenting testing, Blockchain integrity assessment, Application Vulnerability Assessment, and automatic and manual blockchain security analysis. The #third phase of penetration testing is to check any security loopholes and weaknesses and take steps to remove them from the system. This phase includes verification of security weaknesses and vulnerabilities, network penetration testing, exploitation of security weaknesses and vulnerabilities, review and document discoveries. Three Types of Penetration Testing The penetration test is performed in three forms: . Black-Box test . White-box test . Gray-box test Let us discuss these tests: 1.Black-Box Test: Black-box tests or external penetration testing protect the organization from outside attacks. The testers start their work from the point where a real hacker would start. They start with no information about security defenses and the IT infrastructure, with no knowledge about the software architecture, web applications, source code, etc. The type of testing is performed to understand from which points outsiders can breach the security of the blockchain system. Testers also analyze how much damage an outside hacker can do. For performing the black box testing, testers must be experts in using automated methodologies and tools for manual testing. They prepare their map of the target network using their observations. 2. White Box Test: In White Box testing, internal testing, or precise box testing, testers have access to software architecture and source code. This test aims to do an in-depth audit of the entire system. It determines the extent to which an attacker can go and how much damage can occur. 3. Gray-Box Penetration Testing: In this type of testing, the tester does not know the users completely. This test aims to check code structure or application. The tester understands the system’s architecture and data flow. It is a mixture of white and black box testing, giving limited coverage of source code and applications. Advantages of Penetration testing: 1. Disclose Vulnerabilities: Penetration testing helps discover the weakness in the network infrastructure and application configuration. It helps ascertain the requirements of hardware or software improvements to rectify security vulnerabilities. 2. Accurate Risk Assessment: It helps to determine the danger of cyberattacks well in time and gives a chance to take action beforehand. 3. Checking cyber-defense capability: Organizations can detect intrusion, search for intruders and block possible intruders. These actions can ensure the cyber-defense capability and take necessary actions for improvement. 4. Trust: Penetration testing helps in building trust in the blockchain ecosystem that affects the loyalty of suppliers, customers, and partners. Final Thoughts: Blockchain is famous for its data security. So the ecosystem must check the system’s vulnerability using techniques like penetration testing. It would help find out the security loopholes in the blockchain system and take action to protect the system from hackers. Please feel free to comment on the box below if you have queries.

"What makes Decentralized Data Storage System Remarkable?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-are-decentralized-data-storage/","Blog Post","05/03/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","For every business, data storage is an inevitable task for smooth functioning. Across various verticals of business processes, it creates data. It is crucial to store sensitive data in a reliable and secure space. As the data increases with the business growth, it increases the complexity of processing, storing, analyzing, and retrieving. Decentralized data storage systems are the need for a new era of data requirements. Decentralized Data Storage Vs. Centralized Storage Centralized Storage like Cloud? Centralized storage solutions like Cloud gained popularity for data storage. But, centralized data storage is vulnerable to security risks and cyber-attacks. For example, in 2018 and 2021, Facebook’s data was leaked. Such incidents put a question mark on the data security of the centralized data storage system. Blockchain and Cloud Storage: After introducing blockchain technology, it has transformed the internet and related services. Blockchain has extended its services to social media, smart contracts, audio/video streaming, etc. Business enterprises are adopting blockchain technology for cloud data storage. As blockchain is a peer-to-peer networking system, it does not involve central administrative authorities. Ordinary people operate the system, termed miners, that use their computational power to solve complex algorithms in the network. The system awards the miners for their contribution. Cloud storage backed by blockchain technology is an additional stream of business model. This trend has opened opportunities for small business entities to provide their computing power and storage space for data. All the participants in the network get paid for their contributions. Decentralized Storage System: After realizing that centralized storage systems are not secure for sensitive information, decentralized data storage gained popularity. Users can store their data on the decentralized storage system without worrying about the security and privacy of the data. A decentralized storage system stores the chunks of data as blocks, secured by a unique hash or a pair of private-public keys. The ecosystem distributes these data blocks over multiple computers or nodes. For the distribution of data in the network, the shrading process is done. In a decentralized storage system, the data is stored at decentralized locations. Anyone who attempts to hack into the places only gets encrypted data blocks. The hackers will get only a small part of the data, not the entire database. This blockchain feature ensures enhanced data security, which plays a crucial role. The user’s personal information is not included in the data stored at different locations. This feature ensures the privacy of personal data. While retrieving the files, the data files are first validated. If some miner tries altering the data, the network removes that miner. They can recover the altered part of the data from the alternate copy of the original data available at the other locations. The decentralized system adopts data redundancy and load balancing to speed up and secure data retrieval and storage. Many copies of the data are available at various nodes or computers at different locations; even if one node stops working, it does not lead to data loss. The load balancing system optimizes the entire network and restricts traffic concentrated at a single location. Advantages: The decentralized storage system is emerging as an innovative option for data storage in place of a centralized storage system. Benefits of a decentralized storage system: 1. High Reliability: Data is distributed and stored on various hosts in a decentralized system. Copies of original data are stored securely, aiming to establish data redundancy. In case of hardware failure, a backup copy of data is available. Every data block is encrypted using a unique hash, forming an extra layer for data protection. 2. Lower Cost: The cost of storage and hardware is minimum in a decentralized data storage system. It reduces machine performance requirements, lowering the costly investment in high-performing software and hardware. The system continuously uses idle storage space, reducing wastage and extra investment for larger storage space. 3. Load Balancing: In blockchain-based decentralized storage systems, the host node cache frequently uses data locally, and the need for repeated access to the server reduces. A decentralized data storage system eliminates the bottlenecks in the central system resources as the server allocates and optimizes the data storage. 4. Increased Security and Privacy: Data is stored in small chunks or blocks encrypted with unique hashes or public-private keys. There is no storage of users data anywhere. Instead, decentralized nodes act as a storage space for them. This data structure ensures a high level of privacy with security. The disadvantage of Decentralized Storage systems: Decentralized storage systems have many advantages due to their early development stage. But some disadvantages are faced while developing and deploying decentralized storage systems. 1. Lack of Trust: Central regulatory authorities are not involved because of peer-to-peer technology. Establishing trust in the decentralized networks with a lack of accountability for misplaced transactions and lost data becomes difficult. 2. Complexities in Development: The decentralized storage network’s consensus mechanism is complicated. Proof -of-.Storage consensus (PoS) is the fundamental consensus to verify the integrity of the remote files. Every participant node is required to prove they added new records submitted. 3. Security Concerns: Even though the decentralized storage network is bulletproof, the risk of assailants becoming malicious nodes and executing hub attacks remains, distorting the entire network. Developers and researchers are already working on techniques to prevent these attacks to ensure more safety. Final Thoughts: The demand for inexpensive and secure storage technology is rising with the rise in business data volume. With the adoption of blockchain technology, decentralized data storage could be an appropriate option to balance scalability, security, and affordability.

This blockchain aims to decentralize video on demand and video streaming. If you are looking for a blockchain for video streaming, the Theta blockchain is a good option. Let us explore this topic. Theta Blockchain Explained Internet users have been inclined to video and video streaming services. With the popularity of Twitch, YouTube, Live.ly, and the addition of videos to Twitter and Facebook, Tik Tok is a witness to viewer trends. As per the estimates of the networking hardware company Cisco, more than seventy-five percent of the internet bandwidth is used for video streaming. This percentage is expected to reach eighty-two percent in the next few years. This blockchain network encourages the users to share their unused bandwidth and memory for enhancing the overall network. This initiative would lead to better performance of blockchain all over the globe. Theta Token Technology Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism is adopted for the Theta blockchain network. The advantage of this consensus mechanism is that it needs less computational capacity and higher transaction throughput than Proof-of-Work protocols. It is possible to use many devices acting as caching nodes and viewers. Theta blockchain has developed a Resource Oriented Micropayment Pool to handle the scalability issue. To track the delivery of video segments, they have adopted Proof-of-engagement for implementing something. Smart contracts run the collection and distribution of rewards on the platform. Let us now discuss the terms mentioned earlier in detail. 1. Resource-Oriented Micropayment Pool: Theta Token has developed a Resource-Oriented Micropayment Pool for off-chain payment pools so that users can withdraw off-chain. They offer more flexibility than other off-chain solutions due to the resistance design for double-spending. The most significant use of this solution ensures greater scalability with microtransactions off the blockchain. 2. Proof of Engagement: This protocol gives information about the number of viewers that have watched a live video. This information helps provide transparency for advertisers and users to earn Theta tokens in return. This protocol is considered a reliable benchmark to measure video stream engagement and a secure way for advertisements and users to earn Theta tokens for their engagement. 3. Smart contracts for streaming: Smart contracts facilitate reward collection and distribution. Many kinds of smart streaming contracts are used in the Theta network. Examples are viewers gifting rewards to streamers, advertisers rewards for viewers and streamers, premium or paid video content, subscription to decentralized content networks or streamers’ content, and cachers can share rewards with content streamers and viewers. Validators design the smart streaming contracts that ensure that the original entity or person funding the contract does not get involved with validations or distribution. Network Participants in Theta blockchain: 1. Viewers: The viewers consume the video content on #THETA.TV. Viewers are the most critical part of a video streaming network. 2. Advertisers: To promote the products and services, advertisers spend using Theta tokens to buy the advertisement time and sponsor influencers. 3. Streamers/influencers: Streamers are the content producers in the network who create live videos and content for later consumption. The reward is given in the form of Theta Tokens. 4. Caching Nodes: The caching services are provided by the computers and servers to enhance the video stream’s quality and delivery. The reward is also given in the form of Theta Tokens. 5. Ingest Nodes: Various stream resolutions and bitrates are assisted by the nodes. Working of Theta Blockchain: Theta users use the Ethereum ecosystem based on an ERC-20 compliant decentralized video delivery network. ERC-20 tokens leverage the security and deal with various wallets, games, and DEXs. To improve the stream quality, Theta leverages the efficiency and safety of Ethereum. Theta Tokens: Theta network governs the Theta Tokens and provides a lot of functionalities to the users. The users can utilize these tokens as Guardian or Validator nodes to participate in the protocol’s governance and produce blocks. At this point, 1000000000 tokens are in circulation, which is also the total number of tokens. Theta Blockchain: Theta blockchain’s design has end-to-end infrastructure for decentralized video delivery and stream. This feature permits maximum functionality by reducing the cost of the content delivery network. Theta.tv: Users can use the Theta.tv to view and post the videos. Samsung galaxy has announced to include this Dapp. But where to buy Theta: 1. BitPanda: For the residents of Europe, BitPanda is the best option. But it does not process the transactions for non-Europeans. 2. Binance: The best option for Canada, Singapore, the UK, and Australia is the Binance 3. Gate.io: For USA residents, it is the best exchange 4. Easy Crypto: This regulated exchange is the best for New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa. Conclusion: In the 21st century, video streaming is expected to increase many folds, and the Theta blockchain is a promising option for video streaming. This blockchain platform is planning to launch a general streaming platform in addition to streaming videos. If you want to know more, please comment in the box below.

"What Are The Popular Use Cases Of Quorum Blockchain?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-quorum-blockchain/","Blog Post","19/02/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","The adoption of blockchain technology in the finance sector is increasing day by day. Blockchain would transform the finance sector to the last extent. Quorum blockchain is the first step towards common adoption in this sector. Table of Contents • What is the Quorum blockchain? • Quorum Blockchain Use Cases • Features of Quorum Blockchain • Advantages of Quorum Blockchain • Disadvantages of Quorum What is the Quorum blockchain? Quorum is a permissioned blockchain infrastructure specifically focused on enterprise needs for finances. JP Morgan has developed the Quorum blockchain to improve the flaws in the first-generation blockchains adopted in the finance sector. In today’s era, many organizations handle the finance sector data. Hence, they lack information control, transparency, and security. Even though existing blockchains provide immutability and traceability, it is not customizable according to the needs. Quorum Blockchain Use Cases Let us discuss different industry verticals that have adopted the Quorum blockchain. 1. Banking and Finance: The quorum blockchain is the game-changer in financial applications. In the banking and finance sector, Quorum blockchain is beneficial in applications like commercial bank payments, tokenized cash, supply chain finance, institutional trading, capital market data, information exchange regarding sanctions, loan marketplaces and issuing debts, interbank payments in association with central banks, commodity post-trade processing, tokenized cash, etc. The key benefits in the banking and finance industries are risk and credit scoring, account reconciliation, e-invoicing, transparency, and audit trail. 2. Healthcare: Another major sector for this blockchain adoption is the healthcare industry. According to the HIPAA journal, in the healthcare industry, data breaches are high. The quorum blockchain is an appropriate alternative for enhancing the security of healthcare provider data. Synaptic Healthcare Alliance is a notable example of Quorum blockchain adoption. It emphasizes reduction in administrative costs and improvement in data quality. 3. Digital Identity: Uqudo is the prominent use case for using the Quorum blockchain. It helped the users of this mobile-based identity management platform shift their existing IDs and physical ID records to their phones. Quorum blockchain gives an additional layer of security. Users could avail of the facilities like age verification in online shopping, application for telecommunication services, KYC details for the bank account, etc. 4. Supply Chain: Quorum blockchain is gaining popularity in supply chain management. It can support applications like shipment tracking, automated inventory tracking, authentication of luxury goods, etc. Starbucks has adopted quorum blockchain for its supply chain management with the Azure blockchain service of Microsoft. 5. Media and entertainment: Xbox Video Game Royalties has adopted the Quorum blockchain. The crucial advantage is that it reduces the processing time and ensures faster tracking of royalties in video gaming. Features of Quorum Blockchain: 1. Faster: Quorum blockchain is much faster than Ethereum and Bitcoin. It can execute over 150 transactions per second because of its simple consensus mechanism. IBFT consensus designed for Byzantine fault tolerance and RAFT consensus designed for fault tolerance adopted by Quorum is faster than Ethereum’s proof of work consensus. 2. Cost-efficient transactions: Quorum has eliminated the cost associated with gas transactions. Initially, it has forked off Ethereum, but gas usage will be zero. Thus, it is cost-efficient to adopt a quorum blockchain. 3. Permission Management: A quorum blockchain is a permissioned blockchain that does not give all participants open access. It is a blockchain consortium with a designated authority that predetermines and approves the participants. This feature reduces the possibility of catastrophic breaches or failure. 4. Privacy: Quorum blockchain supports both private and on-chain transactions. Private transactions on Quorum are verified without disclosing the details. At the same time, public transactions are traded just like Ethereum transactions. The Constellation system in the Quorum manages secure message transfer. It encrypts specific messages in the communication channel. Advantages of Quorum Blockchain 1. Consensus Algorithm: Quorum has developed a “Quorum-Chain” consensus algorithm that uses a majority voting system. Only a few predetermined nodes have the authority to participate in the voting process; it helps in the transaction verification process. For better fault tolerance, Quorum has adopted Raft-based models and Istanbul BFT. Thus, only a few selected participants can take part in the network. 2. Hybrid Smart Contracts: Solidity is used to program smart contracts set for both public and private participants. The private and smart contracts cannot be transformed into public ones and vice versa to ensure data security. 3. Performance: The performance speed is higher in the Quorum, as in most cases, private contracts are used for transactions instead of public smart contracts. Here, the performance of Raft is better than the Istanbul BFT. Disadvantages of Quorum: 1. Scalability: As the use cases become complex, Quorum’s channel-based approach to privacy creates scalability challenges. 2. Lack of crypto-economics: In the case of Quorum, the consensus is not reached using the mining process. Thus, it does not require a built-in cryptocurrency. If the need for built-in cryptocurrency arises in any use case, it is not possible to develop a digital token or native currency. 3. Lack of Support: Quorum has very few contributors and developers; the users do not have much support for technical matters. Final Thoughts: Blockchain technology can create a revolution in the industry for the finance sector. The Quorum blockchain has the potential to develop a prominent network for the public. It serves the primary issues like information control with complete public transparency. If you have queries, please comment on the box below.

"Whether Fundamental Analysis Is Important In Crypto?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-fundamental-analysis/","Blog Post","13/02/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Before investing in any project, it is always advisable to perform an analysis to ensure the worth of the project. One of the popular analysis techniques is fundamental analysis. In the crypto world, fundamental analysis plays a crucial role in making investment decisions. This article will discuss the fundamental analysis and various techniques involved. Introduction to Fundamental Analysis Investors use fundamental analysis to determine the intrinsic value of an asset or project. Investors consider internal and external factors in determining whether the proposed asset or project is overvalued or undervalued. This information gives guidance in deciding on entry or exit from the project. The basic idea behind fundamental analysis is that an asset could be undervalued or overvalued. When the market corrects its positions, the asset’s real value is reflected. This analysis helps investors determine an asset’s actual valuation against market performance. In the traditional method of fundamental analysis, analysts consider business metrics to estimate the project’s real value. Parameters like price-to-book ratio (to analyze the investors’ value against the book values) or earnings per share (to calculate the amount of profit a company earns against per outstanding share) are considered. Investors do a comparative study for competitor businesses within a niche to ascertain the profitable investment option. But with cryptocurrency, it isn’t easy to apply all the traditional fundamental analysis techniques. Decentralized offerings like Bitcoin (BTC) are like commodities. In the case of cryptos issued by organizations, market experts could not apply traditional FA techniques as investor reviews on social media often are fake and managed artificially. Techniques in the crypto market. 1. On-chain metrics or blockchain metrics Blockchain plays a crucial role in the crypto world, but manually extracting raw data from blockchain networks can be time-consuming. A wide range of APIs (application programming interfaces) can make investment decisions. Many crypto exchanges provide: .Actionable information like total transactions. .The number of active users. .Transaction value. The three main metrics applied are hash rate, active addresses, and status. Let us now discuss these metrics. Hash Rate: Two popular cryptos, Bitcoin and Ethereum, apply Proof-of-Work (POW) consensus mechanism in their blockchain. Crypto miners need to solve a computational puzzle while using POW for transaction verification. One of the primary advantages of adopting POWs is that it prevents malicious transactions from achieving a 51% majority for control. While mining, the hash rate denotes the computational power per second. For calculation of this rate, publicly accessible data is considered. Crypto investors consider the hash rate as an indicator of the health of the proposed cryptocurrency. A high hash rate encourages miners to mine for profits and shows a more secure network. Lower hash rates lead miners to leave the cryptocurrency. Investors do not consider that crypto profitable for investment. Status and Active Addresses: Active addresses are the number of dynamic blockchain addresses in a particular period, like days, weeks, or months. The most popular method for calculating active addresses is finding unique addresses in pre-defined periods to compare the results. Transaction Value: Transaction value shows the total value transaction within a predetermined period. For example, if investors sent 20 Ethereum transactions on the same day, worth $100 each. Then the daily transaction value becomes $2000. It can measure the transaction value in terms of the protocol’s native unit (ETH) or fiat currency, like GBP or USD. 2. Project Metrics: Project metrics also play a crucial role in traditional market indicators resembling the stock market. Crypto’s whitepaper is the most critical project metric. The crypto developers issue whitepapers to outline the project, from its purpose, technology, prospects, goals, etc. Investors want to know more about a project in a comprehensive and informative manner that is not dishonest, overly ambitious, or unrealistic. Another factor influencing the project metrics is the team or creator behind the cryptocurrency. The team’s record can assure their trustworthiness and guide the project’s success. The whitepaper gives information about the following: .Its aim with use cases .Adopted technology like open source, etc .The roadmap for new features and upgrades The distribution and supply scheme for tokens or coins 2. Financial Metrics: Financial metrics cover all the information about the current asset trades, the previous record of the transactions, liquidity, etc. Other factors considered in the financial metrics are: Market Capitalization is calculated by multiplying the current price by the circulating supply. It is a historical cost for buying a unit of crypto asset. Industry experts do not consider the market capitalization method the full proof method as it is practically impossible to calculate the total number of available tokens. Investors believe that low market cap coins possess high growth potential. But in actuality, a high market cap represents high lasting power and more substantial infrastructure. Liquidity and trading volume: Liquidity denotes how easy the crypto is to buy or sell in the market. In an illiquid market, the investors might face the problem of selling the asset at a fair price. They might have to wait for liquidity to increase or lower the asking rate. Liquidity can be determined using the indicator trading volume that can be calculated. Charts are typically used to display the trading volume (mentioned in dollars or native units.) Supply Mechanisms: In supply mechanisms, models like Stock-to-Flow (S2F) ratio are gaining popularity. Similarly, investors consider factors like circulating supply, maximum supply, and inflation rate while making informed decisions. Some projects limit the number of coins available to attract investors to believe that demand for new units will increase their availability. Final thoughts: If calculated correctly, fundamental analysis can show valuable insights about cryptocurrencies. While doing the trading, investors who can separate the true value and the market price using fundamental analysis tools can trade safely. Some insights can be given by technical analysis techniques as well. In the upcoming article, we will discuss various technical analysis tools.

"What Is Hyperledger Iroha And Its Exclusive Use Cases?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-hyperledger-iroha/","Blog Post","05/02/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Are you interested in learning more about Hyperledger Iroha? What distinguishes the Hyperledger Iroha from other blockchains? You’ve come to the correct blog. This article will go over the features and applications of Hyperledger Iroha. Let’s get this discussion started. Table of Contents • What is Hyperledger Iroha and how does it work? • Features of Hyperledger Iroha • Iroha is beneficial in many business applications What is Hyperledger Iroha and how does it work? Hyperledger Iroha is a novel blockchain technology for production use. It focuses mainly on the identification and financial services businesses. Hyperledger is designed for infrastructure projects that want to use distributed ledger technology. Users can create mobile applications specific to their business needs using Hyperledger’s Iroha. It comes with C++, a domain-driven programming language. The consensus algorithm of YAC is another critical feature (Yet Another Consensus Algorithm). A step-by-step method expressed in code that tries to solve issues and execute a set of instructions is an algorithm. Features of Hyperledger Iroha. 1. Building apps on many platforms such as mainframe and mobile supports programming languages such as JS, Java, iOS, and Python. 2. It works with various operating systems, including Linus, Windows, and macOS. 3. If several signatures are required in transaction settlement, it offers multiple keys or multi-signature functionality. 4. Because of its modularity and plug-in nature, it is an easy-to-use technology for developers. Iroha has a wide range of code libraries for developers that enables easy maintenance and deployment. It also helps develop hassle-free applications with easy asset management, secure control and permissions over user activities and roles, and modular design architecture to facilitate the blockchain ecosystem. For example, leading casualty and property insurance group Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Holdings Inc. has adopted Hyperledger Iroha’s blockchain to design insurance contracts like weather derivatives. These are financial contracts to hedge or protect the insurer from weather-related losses. The question arises, what is the difference between public blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin and Permissioned-based Iroha. Public blockchains are permissionless ledgers, which means anyone can join and be given access to the complete network. But, Iroha is a permissioned network, allowing access to only those who have appropriate permission. Only permissioned members can join, interact, and share with the blockchain system. On the other hand, in the case of a public blockchain, the transactions need to be verified and not fake. This proof-of-work process often faces slowness or latency in case of a surge in the volume of transactions. As there is no need for a proof-of-work mechanism, Iroha does not face problems of slowness or latency. Even though there is no native cryptocurrency for Iroha, it can be generated by the eligible participants for enterprise use. Iroha is beneficial in many business applications. Now, we will see the business applications of Iroha. A business establishment can develop and manage simple digital assets like cryptocurrency or complex assets like certificate authenticity, indivisible rights, and patents. 1. Digital Avatars: Digital avatars of real-world assets can be created using Iroha. The parties can transact at zero or low transaction costs. For example, a historical artifact’s current owner can create a digital asset representing the artifact on the blockchain and link the ownership to themselves. The owner can offer a multi-signature transaction with the transfer cost in a predetermined currency to transfer the ownership. The interested parties can share the currency using blockchain transactions with the current owner and receive ownership of the artifact. 2. Certifications: Iroha can develop the certifying identities that allow granting and verifying various certificates issued to candidates by healthcare and educational institutes. Organizations can use blockchain for storing candidates’ academic credentials. The university or educational institution can award the verification rights to authenticate the required certification to the hiring agency or employers during the recruitment process. 3. Smart Contracts: Smart contracts created using Iroha are self-executing contracts regarding the agreement between two parties embedded in code. The contracts execute if one party to the contract satisfies the agreement terms using the blockchain network. Ethereum smart contracts need cumbersome code writing. On the contrary, the same work could be done in Iroha using the built-in commands to complete routine tasks with lower risk and complexity. 4. Know Your Customer (KYC): The essential component of the identity management process is Know Your Customer (KYC). In the financial services industry, KYC is a standard requirement to maintain the identity of the clients. It is very beneficial in accessing the customer’s risk tolerance for investment purposes. It helps financial institutions with money laundering and fraud prevention. KYC involves a significant amount of documentation stored using the Iroha blockchain. All the institutions that need KYC can change this documentation, minimizing the transaction time. In conclusion: Iroha targets to develop distributed ledger technology with an in-built set of codes for executing routine tasks. Iroha is also beneficial in developing industry-specific applications and hardware systems for customizing their services. Please feel free to comment on the box below.

"What is EOSIO? What are its features and benefits?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-eosio/","Blog Post","08/01/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","If you’re familiar with Defi, you’ve probably heard of the phrase EOS. This essay will discuss the EOS’s perks and advantages and why it’s gaining popularity. Let’s start with the EOS notion. Table of Contents • What is EOS • Features of the EOSIO blockchain ecosystem • Benefits of adopting the EOSIO blockchain ecosystem What is EOS? EOS is a decentralized system infrastructure, blockchain-based, that allows the hosting, development, and execution of commercial-scale apps (decentralized applications) on its platform. There is no complete official form of the EOS. EOS includes all the essential functionality individuals and businesses need to build blockchain-based applications similar to web-based apps. It offers secure authentication and access and uses control, data hosting, permissioning, and internet-to-dApp communication. Adopting a web toolkit for interface creation facilitates hassle-free app development.EOS ecosystem has two main components, namely EOS.IO and EOS tokens. EOS.IO is similar to the operating system and controls and manages the EOS blockchain system. It uses blockchain architecture for horizontal and vertical scaling of dApps. At the same time, the EOS token is the cryptocurrency of the EOS network. Features of the EOSIO blockchain ecosystem The technical aspects of the EOSIO make it powerful, flexible, and easy to use. The salient features of the EOSIO are as follows! 1. High throughput, faster confirmations, and low latency: EOSIO ecosystem has adopted Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism that enables low wait time for the network’s nodes to finish validating new blocks for attaining transaction finality. 2. Programmable Economics and Governance: In the EOSIO ecosystem, users can easily modify the governance rules and coin resource allocation with minimum effort due to programmable economics and governance adoption. 3. Business model adaptability: The software developers can deploy immutable smart contracts on the EOSIO platform. This adaptability ensures the business model adaptability without tampering original design and intent of the smart contract. 4. Network upgradability: The applications on the EOSIO are upgradable as this ecosystem allows the developers to add features, made code fixes, and change the application logic for the given access. 5. WebAssembly-based C++ development: WebAssembly C++ programming language ensures the adoption of a powerful programming language for creating smart contracts and interacting with the EOSIO ecosystem and EOS VM. 6. Protocol Resource-efficiency: As the EOSIO protocol has a comprehensive permission system, it can be adopted by a wide range of use cases for the platform. A customer permission structure can be created to safeguard the features of a smart contract. Due to these features of the EOSIO, its popularity is increasing. Benefits of adopting the EOSIO blockchain ecosystem 1. Higher Throughput: The number of transactions processed is usually low in the case of blockchain systems. Most systems’ protocols do not support an increased number of transactions in medium-sized applications. For example, Bitcoin can process 14 operations per second globally for the day at peak use. This low throughput makes it expensive and difficult for the applications to build directly on it. The EOS can perform 860 operations per second on its busiest day. 2. Low Latency: Faster execution of software applications is the demand of today’s world. In the case of the distributed nature of the blockchain, it becomes difficult to maintain the consensus while maintaining low confirmation or execution times. EOSIO uses an innovative consensus method called DPoS (delegated proof of stake). This consensus organizes the validators to work together, leading to faster block time. 3. Upgradable Code: Blockchain technology is popular for its immutable nature, as it prevents on-chain data modification. For many blockchain protocols, once a code is generated, the developer cannot update it in case of any mistake, security vulnerability, or bug. Whereas, in the case of EOSIO, a developer can make changes in the contract code as long as necessary. 4. Extendable accounts: One of the popular features of blockchain technology is the authentication’s public/private key nature, which enhances account security. The private key is mapped with the corresponding public key in this case. In contrast, EOSIO supports the development of account construct on these key pairs. This feature means that the developer can change or update the key pairs and allot them as human names instead of cryptographic strings of letters and numbers to enhance experience and usability. In conclusion, the EOSIO blockchain ecosystem is beneficial to use cases requiring modifying the block codes for valid reasons like bugs, security vulnerability, etc. As the speed of transactions is faster than other platforms, it is the best option for organizations with a high turnover of transactions.

"What is ENS? Ethereum Name Service Explained","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-ens/","Blog Post","08/01/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","ENS or Ethereum Name Service is the naming protocol of the decentralized internet that aims to establish portable Web 3.0 user names. All decentralized apps (Dapps) and blockchains can use ENS. The blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors are very technical. Thus, it needs to be clarified for first-time users and people who are not techno-savvy. For any crypto transaction, participants need a long public wallet address. This public wallet is composed of a long string of letters and digits. Another critical point is participants have different public addresses for every cryptocurrency. It is a tedious and confusing task for crypto beginners to manage these public wallet addresses. Ethereum name service or ENS is a unique concept that aims to create a universal nickname for decentralized websites and public addresses. ENS service would make decentralized finance and the crypto sector simpler for users. After adopting the ENS, the users can use a single ENS domain like “John. eth” instead of a long string of unreadable credentials. ENS domains can apply to any NFTs and cryptos. Let us discuss ENS more and how it works. What is Ethereum Name Service? ENS is a naming protocol built in the Ethereum blockchain. It enables the translation of machine-readable addresses to human-readable nicknames. For instance, if person ‘A’ wants to pay person ‘B’ using cryptocurrencies, then person B is required to give his Ethereum public address. It is 42 hexadecimal characters long. This public address might look like “0xBA25EF3F8B8A186998338A2ADA83755GA2D698E” With the help of the ENS system, person B can create a nickname with an underlying link for it. Now, person B can share ENS for the execution of the transactions.Along with Ethereum addresses, ENS creates human-readable domains for websites, crypto wallets, metadata, and content hashes. Under a single nickname, it connects all your addresses and websites for receiving all kinds of NFTs and cryptocurrencies. ENS is a decentralized and blockchain-secured domain naming service. That means there is only one controlling, regulating authority enhancing its security. How does ENS work? The Ethereum Name Service is made up of two main components. These are the registry and the resolvers, respectively. Registry The registry comprises a smart contract that keeps track of all domains and subdomains while maintaining three critical bits of information about each. . The domain’s owner . The domain’s resolver . The caching time-to-live for all the records that are under the domain The ENS registry’s purpose is straightforward: it maps a name to the resolver responsible for it. Meanwhile, domain owners in the ENS registry are permitted to: . Subdomain ownership should be changed. . Transfer domain ownership to another address. . Set domain resolver and TTL. . Set the domain’s resolver and time-to-live (TTL). Resolvers On the other hand, Resolvers are in charge of converting the names into addresses. Every contract that meets the requirements can operate as a resolver in the Ethereum Name Service. However, resolving a name in ENS is a two-step procedure. The first is to inquire with the registration as to which resolver is in charge of the given name. The second is to ask that specific resolver for the query’s answer. Registry The registry comprises a smart contract that keeps track of all domains and subdomains while maintaining three critical bits of information about each. These are the pieces: . The domain’s owner . The domain’s resolver . The caching time-to-live for all records inside the domain The ENS registry’s purpose is straightforward: it maps a name to the resolver which is responsible for it. Meanwhile, domain owners in the ENS registry are permitted to: . Subdomain ownership should be changed. . Transfer domain ownership to another address. . Set the domain’s resolver and time-to-live (TTL). Resolvers On the other hand, Resolvers are in charge of converting the names into addresses. Every contract that meets the requirements can operate as a resolver in the Ethereum Name Service. However, resolving a name in ENS is a two-step procedure. The first is to inquire with the registration as to which resolver is in charge of the given name. The second is to ask that specific resolver for the query’s answer. ENS app helps those who want to generate their web3 username. Once the desired username is available, users need to follow simple registration steps. After completing the registration process, the domain user can link their websites, crypto wallets, etc. They can also create multiple sub-domains, like website.john.eth or email.john.eth, for connecting to the same ENS domain. Governance of the Ethereum Name Service The Ethereum Name Service is administered by several different arms, each with its significance. Token ENS + Distribution The ENS token is a standard token on the Ethereum network that follows the ERC-20 standard. Its primary function is to be used for system governance. Token holders can make suggestions and vote on them. The forum talk.ens.domains is the primary location for community members to debate ideas and governance issues. The Ethereum Name Service is managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (ENS DAO) in the spirit of decentralization (DAO). The DAO is driven by holders of the ENS token, who can make proposals and vote on them to determine the protocol’s future evolution. ENS Foundation The ENS Foundation, an existing Cayman Islands Foundation, represents the ENS DAO. It serves several functions, including: . To comply with tax rules because, in the absence of a legal organization, DAO participants may be liable for a percentage of the DAO’s profits, even if they do not have access to the funds. . To get into agreements with other businesses. . To give members in the DAO limited accountability for the DAO’s actions. Why is ENS outstanding? In the web3.0 version, Ethereum Name Service is like the Domain Name Service. The difference between ENS and DNS is that ENS is a decentralized alternative or traditional DNS for the internet. ENS eliminates the risks associated with DNS. ENS is censorship-resistant and more secure as it is built of blockchain-based Ethereum protocol. ENS is the first service that replaces blockchain and crypto addresses with human-readable nicknames.These ENS can be used across all Dapps, wallets, and decentralized websites. This system transforms complex strings of characters into simple, short, and human-readable links, which are easier for blockchain beginners. Final Thoughts: ENS is the rising star on the horizon of Web 3.0 and gaining popularity as it creates human-readable nicknames for public blockchain addresses. As ENS is backed by blockchain technology and distributed, it ensures greater security for domain names. Please feel free to comment on the box below if you have queries.

"Self-Sovereign Identity: Control of Your Personal Data & Identity","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/","Blog Post","04/01/2022","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","All over the world, internet users are worried about cyber-attacks, security, business integrity, and consumer privacy. Blockchain technology and self-sovereign identity (SSI) principles can resolve this issue. We consider these technologies the future of digital identity. These technologies aim at balancing accurate digital identity verification along with self-advocacy. Table of Contents • What is Self-Sovereign Identity? • 3 Pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity • Organizations, People, and Developers can all benefit from Self-Sovereign Identity Management • What Is the Process of Self-Sovereign Identity Management? • SSI Pillar 1: Blockchain • SSI Pillar 2: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) • SSI Pillar 3: Verifiable Credentials (VCs) • Benefits of Self-Sovereign Identity • Final Thoughts What is Self-Sovereign Identity? SSI stands for Self-Sovereign Identity, which is a tamper-free digital identity. It secures users’ log-ins in personal and professional systems. The adoption of SSI is increasing as it ensures better security and privacy than digital identities, like Facebook or Google-based sign-ups. Internet users have used their Facebook or Google profiles to unlock public domains like Amazon, Instagram, eBay, Domino’s, etc. All these platforms carry the risk of hacking and are prone to revealing your information without your realizing it. Blockchain technology backs SSI. People who use SSI for any service have control over their identity. In the SSI system, the issuer issues digitally signed documents. These documents establish trust in a blockchain network. Users can use the documents on a blockchain-based app to authenticate their digital identity. 3 Pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity are: Blockchain: Blockchain is a computer network that shares a decentralized database that stores information in a way that makes it hard to change, hack, or cheat the system. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Decentralized Identifiers can identify yourself online without relying on a central organization or company to verify your identity. Instead, you can use a unique code stored on a blockchain to show who you are. This feature means you have more control over who can see and use your personal information. It’s like how you use a driver’s license or passport in the real world to prove who you are. Verifiable Credentials (VCs): Verifiable Credentials are digital versions of the paper and digital credentials that can be shown to verifiers. These digital versions are encrypted and secure. For example, a new hospital opens, and all employees must have a three-year First Aid training certificate. Holder: Mr. A, the applicant for the job First Aid Training Organization is the issuer. Verifier: Hospital In a Self-Sovereign Identity system, this is how these roles work together: Mr. A (the holder) has an app on his phone that stores his Verifiable Credentials. This app is called a digital identity wallet. Mr. A does well in his First Aid training and passes. The training organization gives him a digital certificate of training, which he stores safely on his app. His certification is no longer accessible to frauds. Mr. A applies to the hospital (the verifier) and gives them his Verifiable Credential (the certificate). The hospital can instantly verify his credentials by scanning a QR code. In this case, the hospital only trusted the First Aid Training for heart patients organization to give out certificates so that Mr. A couldn’t make a fake one. The DID of the training organization is public information, and verifiers will only accept Verifiable credentials issued by this issuer. The verification would only succeed if someone changed the information on Mr. A’s digital certificate. The certificate is not genuine because either the signature doesn’t match the issuers DID or the hash, which acts like a digital fingerprint, needs to be corrected. Principles of SSI: Even though different thought leaders and organizations disagree on Self-Sovereign Identity, ten fundamental principles sum up the most critical parts of SSI. 1. Existence: A user can exist in the digital world without the involvement of a third party. 2. Control: People must control their digital identities and personal information. 3. Access: Users must be able to access their data easily. 4. Transparency: The public must understand how an identity system and its algorithms are managed and updated. The design of the solution should be based on open software and protocols. 5. Persistence: People’s identities must last. Solution developers should place enough foundational infrastructure and design business and operation models for a long time. 6. Portability: People should be able to bring their identities and credentials anywhere and move their data from one platform to another. It is not limited to a single platform. 7. Interoperability: Identifiers should be usable by as many stakeholders as possible. Through a digital identity system, organizations, databases, and registries must be able to talk to each other quickly and efficiently worldwide. 8. Consent: The user must give explicit permission for an entity to use or access a user’s data. People should be able to talk to each other and understand how to consent. 9. Minimization: A digital identity solution should let people share the least information another party needs. This principle keeps people from giving out too much optional personal information. 10. Protection: People should have the right to privacy, and information should be safe from being changed or watched. All of the data is encrypted from start to finish. Organizations, People, and Developers can all benefit from Self-Sovereign Identity Management Organizations Reduce costs, wasted time, and wasted resources by checking credentials like nurse licenses or online course completion certificates right away instead of waiting days, weeks, or months. Issue fraud-proof Verifiable Credentials quickly and for a lot less money Public-key cryptography is a way to make security better. By keeping fewer user data, you can reduce the chance of being the target of cyber attacks, breaches, lawsuits, and fines. Individuals You own and control your identity without relying on a third party. You can make your DIDs and use a digital wallet to manage your information. You can choose the data to be shared and with whom, and you can take access away from the data at any time. Centralized servers don’t keep any personal information in one place. You can give what is needed. For example, you don’t have to show your full address if you only need to validate your age. Developers Make apps that don’t need a password, which makes the user experience better. Getting rid of inefficient ways to verify your identity, like sending a text or email as a second step. Ask users for information instead of a third party. What Is the Process of Self-Sovereign Identity Management? We’ll go through the fundamental features of SSI’s three pillars: blockchain, Decentralized Identifiers, and Verifiable Credentials, as well as how they interact. SSI Pillar 1: Blockchain Blockchain is a mechanism for storing data on a digitally distributed database shared by computers in the blockchain network. These computers are named nodes. Because of how blockchain is structured, it is challenging to manipulate, hack, or cheat the system. Each block contains unique data about the previous block and once verified, the system adds the verified blocks to the blockchain. Key Features of SSI Blockchain: 1. Decentralized: Blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer network, meaning no single person can change or influence how a blockchain works. Nodes can be located anywhere worldwide if they have the necessary network equipment. If the blockchain is permissionless, anyone can join the network. 2. Distributed ledger (transaction record): Each node in the network receives a full copy of the blockchain, which helps verify that it has not been tampered. Once the new data is confirmed, the system adds it to everyone’s copy of the blockchain. 3. High security combined with immutability: Blocks cannot be tampered with or reversed. Each block contains a hash (a string of letters and numbers) of the previous block, which functions as a unique digital fingerprint. If the hash of a block changes, everyone in the network knows it has been tampered with, and nodes reject tampered blocks to prevent their addition to the blockchain. Consider a business where only one individual or group can access financial information and history. Who would know if they changed the numbers? Because there may be little or no traceable proof or record of this modification, they may be able to steal money or commit fraud. However, for all transactions recorded on a permissioned blockchain, other staff members may audit and verify them to ensure accuracy. In a Self-Sovereign Identity system, each participant uses the blockchain in the following ways: 4. Holder: The owner of a Verifiable Credential (for example, a driver’s license) has a public DID on the blockchain. When an issuer, such as a government department, issues a Verifiable Credential to a bearer, they sign it with DID and associated private key. The department’s DID and accompanying public key can store on the blockchain. 5. Verifier: A verifier, such as an on-demand driving service, can check the blockchain to determine that the government department they trust issued the license because the issuer DID sign the Credential, which is on the blockchain. A blockchain provides the exact source of truth for the holder, issuer, and verifier regarding which credentials are valid and who confirms the authenticity of the data inside the credentials. SSI Pillar 2: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) Every online presence has a digital identity, such as an email address or user name. To connect to websites and apps nowadays, we primarily rely on centralized identifiers such as Google, Facebook, email providers, or mobile network carriers. However, these digital identities are frequently used to torment, track, and exchange user data. Companies can find out who we messaged, what we bought, where we live, and so on. Fortunately, decentralized identifiers (DIDs) enable people to construct digital identities securely linked to their Verifiable Credentials and not divulge personal information without authorization. DIDs provide us with complete ownership and control over our data. Having several DIDs makes it more difficult for someone to connect those DIDs. A DID is a globally unique identifier consisting of a string of letters and digits that are not associated with any organization. Relevant persons have access to DIDs. A DID example within a Self-Sovereign Identity system A DID: The user makes it It includes one or more private key and public key pairs. It does not contain any personal information or wallet information. Allows for private and secure communications between two parties that may be verified at any time and from any location. Select a DID in the Self-Sovereign Identity system to approve a verifier. Users can create as many DIDs as they wish for various reasons and interactions. Users can make as many DIDs as they want to for multiple reasons and exchanges. Someone, for example, can generate three distinct DIDs: DID 1: Only for their internet buying DID 2: For cryptocurrency-related services such as trading and purchasing NFTs. DID 3: Professional purposes, such as possessing a university degree and course certificates In a self-sovereign identity system, people can have many DIDs. DIDs Include Private and Public Keys First, grasp what encryption is to understand how private and public keys work. Encryption encrypts a message’s contents so only specific persons can read it. There are two kinds of encryption: Symmetric encryption uses a single key (password) to encrypt and decrypt data. Consider securing access to a document with a password. To open the document, we must type the password into the search box. The document is encrypted and decrypted in this example using a single password (key). Asymmetric encryption occurs when the encryption key (also known as the public key) and the matching decryption key (commonly known as the private key) are distinct. Public-key encryption is another name for asymmetric encryption. She protects the document with an encryption program and a password she chooses. She sends the message to B, who cannot open it since he does not know the password, just as he does not have a “key” to open the lock to access the document. Miss A does not want to send the password via email because it may be used to decrypt any message between Miss A and B. This is the issue with symmetric encryption, which asymmetric encryption attempts to address. Miss A and B must generate a key pair on their laptops to use asymmetric encryption. A public and private key will be associated with one another. Only the matching private key can decode data when a public key is used to encrypt data. However, even if you know someone’s public key, you won’t be able to access their private key. Miss A and B can converse securely by using asymmetric encryption. They begin by exchanging their public keys. Miss A encrypts her secret paper using B’s public key before sending it. B then unlocks the document with his private key. Only B can decipher the communication because of asymmetrical encryption. Miss A, too, cannot decrypt it since she lacks B’s secret key. B and Miss A should never reveal their private key to anyone. If a hacker obtains B’s private keys, they can decode all messages meant for B. The hacker, however, cannot decrypt texts sent to Miss A because this requires her private key. Identity as Self-Sovereign DID includes one or more private and public keys. Every DID includes one or more private and public keys. Every DID includes one or more private and public keys. Private key: A long string of letters and numbers used to confirm ownership, authorize consent to share specified data, and sign Verifiable Credentials. A private key is analogous to a master key that has access to all your information, and the owner should never disclose their private key to anyone. Public key: A long string of letters and numbers that can be safely shared with anyone to whom you want to give specific information. Consider a public mailbox on the street where many people know the location. Anyone can put letters in, but only the owner can open them. The mailbox’s address would be like the public key, which is secure for everyone to know. The mailbox owner is the only one with access to the private key required to open the mailbox. To increase security, produce a new public key for each transaction with a separate party to decrease the possibility of someone comparing data. This method is analogous to using a different password for each new website for which you open an account. It’s not a good idea to use “itsreallyme123” on every website. Use longer and more complex passwords to lessen the danger of your information being compromised. SSI Pillar 3: Verifiable Credentials (VCs) Anyone can counterfeit ID cards, diplomas, and degrees. Corporations have few to no options for validating their authenticity without going through the time-consuming, manual process of authenticating with the Credential’s issuer, such as a university or licensing authority. Verifiable Credentials, on the other hand, allow verifiers such as an employer, government department, or app to check credentials in seconds! Verifiable Credentials are a digital, cryptographically secure variant of paper and digital credentials that individuals can submit to parties that require them for verification. An employer, for example, might quickly scan a job candidate’s QR code to validate that they have a bachelor’s degree rather than spending days or weeks contacting universities to check if someone’s degree is authentic. Critical Benefits of Verifiable Credentials Issuing Organizations: Save money and time by issuing Verifiable Credentials efficiently, including the option to issue bulk, avoid fraud, and eliminate human effort. Validating Organizations: Save time, resources, and money by rapidly verifying credentials without contacting issuing organizations. Individuals: Only submit pertinent information to a verifier without giving extra information and confirm assertions without revealing actual data. Developers: Improve the user experience by authenticating securely without using passwords. Benefits of Self-Sovereign Identity: SSI technology is helpful to the beneficiaries and service providers. It provides an easily auditable, transparent, secure, and human-error-free system for identity management. Data Privacy in Health Care: The healthcare industry must maintain the privacy of medical records. Lumedic Exchange ensures the maintenance of patient data privacy. It transmits healthcare records using SSI-based authentication between insurers, hospitals, and drugstores. Management of Contagious Diseases: The International Air Transport Association (IATA) records global air travelers to prevent contagious diseases. IATA constantly identifies the passengers’ COVID-19 test and vaccination status in this pandemic situation. Staff Identification System: SSI provides cost-effective employee identification systems. It facilitates unrestricted movement during emergencies. In case of a crisis, it enables hassle-free movement of emergency health workers like doctors and nurses. Citizen Identity System: Use cases of SSI-based verification systems are for availing facilities like social security, banking, healthcare, education, taxation, etc. Efficient Financial Services: SSI systems can enhance SSI speed to a great extent in the financial sector. Bonifil’s Member Pass is an SSI-based identity authentication system in the USA that resolves problems related to Credit Union Services. Final Thoughts With blockchain technology, SSI offers an authentic and secure exchange of keys. The scope of SSI is increasing daily, and it would be interesting to witness the journey.

"Decentralized Apps (DApps) creating their place in Application’s industry","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-are-the-decentralized-apps/","Blog Post","20/12/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","After introducing smartphones and other gadgets, almost everyone is familiar with the term apps. People use phone apps for games, social media like Instagram and Snapchat, entertainment like YouTube, etc. User’s all needs could be satisfied with mobile apps. Nowadays, a new form of an app is gaining popularity -Decentralized apps. What are the Decentralized apps (Dapps)? The decentralized apps use blockchain technology and have fundamental differences from web apps. Standard apps run on centralized servers belonging to that company. In contrast, decentralized apps (Dapps) are developed on blockchain technology. It has decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. The most important advantage of the blockchain is that it is a distributed ledger. IT means every participant of the blockchain has a copy of the transaction. No single computer or organization has exclusive access to the data stored on the blockchain network. The data blocks on the blockchain are immutable, which means it is impossible to change the data stored. Because of this feature, blockchain is more secure and enhances transparency, as it does not hide information. Categories of Dapps: Even though Dapps manage and generate tokens, they don’t have to be transaction apps like Bitcoin. Tokens generated by these Dapps are used as a reward system for encouraging nodes to add value to the app. Type 1 DApps: Dapps, with their own blockchain system, fall under type 1. A popular example is Bitcoin and Litecoin blockchains. We can compare their functionality with operating systems like MAC OS, Windows, etc. Type 2 Dapps: Type 2 DApps use the underlying blockchain of type 1 apps. They have their tokens and necessary protocols for their functioning. The best example of type 2 DApps is Omni Protocol. It is a distributed trading platform based on the Bitcoin blockchain and ensures trustless, peerless, and effortless exchange of assets or value between transacting parties. Type3 Dapps: Type 3 DApps are based on the protocol of type 2 applications. The best example of Type 3 Dapps is SAFE NETWORK (Secure Access For Everyone). It is a communication and data storage network that replaces data servers and centers with more facilities for users. Features of Dapps 1. Open-Source: Dapps are open-source, meaning the codebase is freely available. For changes in the working or structure of the app, approval of most of the participants is necessary. 2. Decentralized: These Dapps adopt a public and decentralized blockchain that stores all the information and operations of the app. This technique ensures transparency and security. 3. Protocol: Protocol is used to show proof of value, ensuring the value of a particular process. It can verify the authenticity of a specific process. 4. Incentive: Dapps offer some cryptographic tokens to the users as an incentive. These tokens are liquid assets and work as an incentive for supporting the blockchain Dapps ecosystem. 5. Scalable: As the Dapps are decentralized, blockchain-based applications, it offers peer-to-peer validation. 6. Availability: As Dapps have a peer-to-peer network, they cannot die or crash entirely from the system. Dapps are always available for the participants. 7. Secured: Because of the adoption of blockchain, smart contracts, and Proof-of-Work mechanisms, Dapps are reliable, trustworthy, and impossible to hack. Top Decentralized Apps Even though there as many platforms available for Dapps, the most popular blockchain platforms are Ethereum, EOS, and Tron. Let us discuss these platforms briefly. Ethereum: ETH or Ethereum is popular for ensuring true decentralization and security. But, in terms of scalability (transaction processing ability at scale), Ethereum is not a good option. For many blockchain projects, including over 2500 Dapps, Ethereum has been adopted. BTH is the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, which is a version of Bitcoin. Even though it is expensive, it is the best option for developing Dapps. EOS: EOS has 21 witnesses or validators for verifying the transactions based on Proof Of Stake consensus. They pay the validators for securing the network with voting. With EOS for scalability, rational decentralization is applied. TRON: Like EOS, TRON also uses the Delegated Proof of Stake consensus algorithm. TRON is a new blockchain platform than Ethereum but has the potential to take the place of Ethereum. For gambling sites and gaming applications, TRON is a famous blockchain platform. Around 1500 Dapps are developed on TRON. Final Thoughts: After the emergence of blockchain technology and continuous inventions, Dapps are gaining popularity. Dapps offer more transparency and security than web apps. The scope for Dapps is expected to grow in the future once blockchain technology becomes the first choice for techies. In the following articles, we will explore more about Dapps.

"What Is Hyperledger Fabric And Its Exclusive Features?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-hyperledger/","Blog Post","13/12/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","The operating models of a wide range of sectors have changed due to the adoption of blockchain technology. As a result, before considering blockchain platforms for business case building, it’s critical to grasp the various aspects. This article will determine these characteristics and the benefits of using the Hyperledger Fabric to construct the Hyperledger blockchain. Why Hyperledger Fabric for Business? Every company has various needs in customization and functionalities to ensure that blockchain solutions achieve their goals. While the blockchain has potential, it isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer for all businesses. Hyperledger is a platform that connects developers, users, and providers from many industries. These experts tweak the many aspects of blockchain to tailor solutions to diverse sectors.There are five frameworks: Fabric, Iroha, Sawtooth, Burrow, and Indy. Fabric is the most mature and first framework of Hyperledger. Advantages of Hyperledger Fabric. 1. Flexible Architecture: The Hyperledger Fabric is adjustable and customized as per the organization’s requirements. Organizations can build applications based on their specific requirements. The firm’s architecture ensures the customization of new blockchain technology. This flexibility is helpful while accessing the system. For example, a user identity management system can be built on the Hyperledger Fabric using a blockchain platform. 2. High Transaction Speed: One significant barrier for organizations to opt for blockchain technology is transaction speed. Hyperledger Fabric can process more than a thousand transactions per second at a high rate. This factor is a significant boost for the organizations to adopt Hyperledger Fabric. 3. Backed by Tech Giants: Big enterprise companies like Intel, IBM, and Cisco have backed Hyperledger Fabric, which has enhanced its stability and confidence for business enterprises. These enterprises are inclined to build their blockchain applications on platforms of established tech companies. 4. Smart Contracts: Like other frameworks, smart contracts are also possible in Hyperledger Fabric. This smart contract is called a Chaincode. The crucial characteristic of chaincode is developing complex logic for industries with complicated business logic like the supply chain industry. 5. Scalability, Trust level, and Productivity: Modular architecture is applied in the hyperledger Fabric that divides the transaction process into three phases: chained code, i.e., distributed logical processing and agreement, transaction ordering, and verification and validation of the transaction. Due to these separations, the advantages to the system are fewer levels of trust needed for node types, decentralization of the network, and optimization of the performance. 6. The transactions are handled differently from other structures: the transaction speed and efficiency increase due to the hyperledger fabric structure. For example, the transaction volume increases with the number of participants in the stock market. Therefore, for an increased number of transactions in the blockchain, Hyperledger Fabric enhances its performance and scalability. 7. Information access: Organizations must maintain the confidentiality of the data elements due to the surge in competition and laws regulating and protecting the confidentiality of personal data. Data confidentiality can be supported by dividing the data into blockchains. Hyperledger fabric channels only allow the transfer to predetermined sectors. In an extensive network of chains, hyperledger fabric can create a private channel of participants to share the data. 8. Network Ceaselessness: A key value is generated in each transaction linked to the register. This key value can be updated, created, or deleted. Hyperledger fabric minimizes the work necessary to create simple reports and execute audit functions. Organizations can create reports on the goods situated at different locations and transport objects with this technology. 9. Protecting sensitive data and digital passwords: Hardware Security Module (HSM) support is vital in managing and protecting the digital keys for strong authentication. HSM improves confidential data and critical protection for identity management scenarios. 10. Supports plug-in components: The developer can create embedded components in the architecture in the Hyperledger Fabric. For example, some elements can be compressed when required in the fastest way. The users can adopt the blockchain platform if they want to develop access to a system. This development can be created using Hyperledger Fabric. In conclusion : The above benefits denote a wide range of benefits beneficial in developing industrial applications by adopting blockchain technology. Hyperledger Fabric does not need built-in cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Bitcoin. Hyperledger Fabric aims to provide a private, secure, and trustworthy environment for enterprises as this system can deal with a massive amount of data with speed and efficiency.

"What Is Hyperledger Indy? What are its distinct features?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-hyperledger-indy/","Blog Post","07/12/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Are you looking for a platform that can give you control over your data and identity? Then, Hyperledger Indy might be the best option for you. Do you want to know more about Hyperledger Indy? Is this article for you? We will discuss the features and advantages of Indy in this article.While performing various tasks, we need to disclose our personal information on online platforms in this digital world. The risk factor increases with performing financial transactions. Even though online platforms claim to be secured, identity thefts increase alarmingly worldwide. Here, Hyperledger Indy comes into the picture. Table of Contents • What is Hyperledger Indy? • Features of Hyperledger Indy • Why is Hyperledger Indy gaining popularity? • Some infrastructure issues in the existing system What is Hyperledger Indy? Hyperledger Indy architecture creates digital identities that have roots in the blockchain or any other distrusted ledger format. With this architecture, the user can access many tools, libraries, reusable components, etc. The best part of this architecture is that every identity is interoperable across organizational silos, multiple domains, and applications.Because of the transparent approach, users know who they are dealing with and who can verify their information before interacting. Features of Hyperledger Indy: 1. Verifiable Claims: While performing the tasks practically, users might have different credentials for their identities, like birth certificates or driver’s licenses.Hyperledger Indy can make it more powerful. We can generate a single ID from the ledger with the Indy system. There is no need to submit all IDs every time. 2. Self-Sovereignty: In Hyperledger Indy, the identities are stored on a distributed ledger. This ledger ensures security for unique artifacts like proof of existence, cryptographic accumulators, public keys, etc.Only the user can remove or change the identity from it. 3. Privacy: Hyperledger Indy documentation specifies how privacy settings would be preserved and how to operate with any party without contradiction. This document also mentions how it ensures security in a decentralized system. 4. Identity Correlation-resistant: Identity correlation-resistant is the crucial feature of the Hyperledger Indy. It ensures that two IDs or similar identifications in the ledger will not connect. 5. Purpose-Built: This platform is suitable for integration in any company dealing with identities. A different setup is not necessary for incorporating the Indy platform in any industry. Hyperledger Indy takes all the functionalities to care. 6. Peer-to-peer Connection: This platform has a peer-to-peer connection, meaning communication can happen between two peers. The server acts as a middleman. 7. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): In this platform, all the decentralized identifiers are unique and resolvable globally with no involvement of the central party.This feature means they allotted a unique identifier to every decentralized identity on the platform. The platform minimizes identity theft, as no other party can use someone else’s identity as their own. 8. Zero-knowledge Proofs: The user can choose to disclose and release the information needed if it provides credentials. For Example, if the user wants to disclose the birth certificate, they have the facility to do so. This facility gives additional control to the users over their information. Why is Hyperledger Indy gaining popularity? At the time of the start of the era of the internet, the aim was to connect people with no intermediary. But, over time, the internet has become privatized, and third-party intermediaries emerged.Now, these intermediaries have become a fundamental part of this infrastructure. The risk associated with the changes in the information and misuse of the information by the third party has increased.Hackers can misuse this massive pool of information. The threat of data breaches has also increased. It can change this situation using with the adoption of Hyperledger Indy. Some infrastructure issues in the existing system Let us start. 1. Lack of transparency: In centralized systems, because of the absence of clarity, the chances of privacy violation issues are more. Some known examples are fine on Facebook for using user data for promoting advertisements, illegal patient data sharing by DeepMind, Cambridge Analytica Scandal. 2. Lack of Control: Major flaw of the centralized system is that the user does not have control over the information. For Example, even after deleting the Facebook account, your personal information remains in the database, which cannot be deleted completely. 3. Absence of Global Identity: There is no global record system in the centralized system. The lack of a centralized system results in submitting certain documents like driving license, passport, PAN card, etc. 4. Identity Theft: There is always a threat of identity theft by hackers. The problem comes when hackers demand ransom for getting back your data. Conclusion: The above factors have led to the need for a secured identity management system. The Hyperledger Indy efficiently manages and ensures the identity of the users. The Hyperledger Indy helps to solve the issues related to the identities. It is straightforward to issue identities using decentralized identities. If you have queries, please comment in the box below. Team Blockchain Shiksha would love to solve your questions.© Thank You!

It’s fascinating to learn about the advantages of blockchain tokenization and how it affects the banking industry. Let’s start with the concept of asset tokenization. Table of Contents • What is Asset Tokenization? • Benefits of the Assets Tokens • Future Prospects of the Tokenization What is Asset Tokenization? Asset Tokenization is a process through which assets are converted into tokens.Thanks to the advent and use of new technology, the world has undergone a tremendous transformation to a decentralized economy in recent years. This transformation affects every facet of life, from everyday activities like banking transactions to business interactions. Blockchain adoption is a significant step toward realizing the dream of a cashless society. At this stage, the concept of tokenization of assets comes. Asset tokenization refers to a process in which the issuer creates digital tokens on a blockchain or distributed ledger representing either physical or digital assets. Once an investor buys a token representing an asset on a blockchain network, any authority cannot change or erase the ownership of that asset. The asset’s ownership remains immutable. These tokens are stored on the blockchain network and store the assets’ value and ownership rights. Whereas, in the real world, these assets represented by the tokens exist. The tokenization process generally involves the creation of a variant of the initial coin offering (ICO), which is also termed a security token offering (STO). There is a difference between STO and ICO in variants like equity, payment, or utility tokens. These tokens are released by leveraging smart contracts on specialized exchanges or direct sales. Any investor interested in partial or complete ownership of assets can own the desired quantity of digital ownership tokens. In this way, individuals gain partial or full ownership of a specific asset. Benefits of the Assets Tokens The tokenization ensures a compelling promise in the financial world, characterized by inclusivity, enhanced efficiency, and transactional fairness and transparency in asset management. The adoption of tokens can help minimize the friction in creating, purchasing, and selling securities. Following benefits ensure that investors and sellers can endure the economy of everything with tokenization. (1) Improvement in liquidity: Tokenization could be done for private securities or commonly illiquid assets like fine art. Users can trade these tokens on the secondary market as per the issuer’s choice. This process results in access to a broad base of traders, thereby increasing the liquidity of the tokens. The investors achieve freedom, and sellers could get better value from the tokenized assets. In this way, tokenization can increase the liquidity of physical and illiquid assets. (2) Accountability and Transparency: The transparency in the transaction has increased with the implementation of tokenization on blockchain technology. These tokens can embed token holders’ legal responsibilities and rights directly in the token. The records of ownership of tokens are immutable for specific assets. These tokenization features could help in enhancing transparency in the transactions. The rights and responsibilities of tokenized assets are similar to the previous owners. (3) Faster transactions at lower prices: One of the most vital benefits of blockchain usage in tokenization is the completion of transactions at faster speeds and lower costs. The smart contracts in the token trade ensure the automation of specific parts in the exchange process. Software algorithms in smart contracts integrate the blockchain with trigger actions based on specific predefined parameters. It minimizes overall administrative expenses, primarily buying and selling, reduced with automation processes. Transacting parties can execute the deals faster due to less number of intermediaries. (4) Better accessibility for investment options: Tokenization can improve the accessibility of different options for investment in assets. New participants have fewer barriers to entry with lower minimum investment amounts and periods of holding the tokenized assets. The customers could purchase the tokens representing minimal tokenized asset shares due to their higher divisibility. This feature lowers the investment period ensuring better liquidity with security tokens. The exchange of tokens is an easy process for the investors as the tokens are available in the second market worldwide, albeit with regulatory limits. Future Prospects of the Tokenization The advantages mentioned above of tokenization apply to many generally illiquid asset classes. Similarly, the tokenization of the illiquid assets can benefit from better efficiency and transparency and the reduced requirement of minimum investments. The adoption of tokenization in areas of the fine art sector and real estate are expected to grow. As no particular type of assets can be tokenized, the issuers can opt for tokenization of all categories of assets, namely virtual assets like securities, etc. The market for tokenization would also experience a positive impact on the adoption of blockchain technology worldwide in various industries. In conclusion, the tokenization of illiquid assets would positively impact the future economy. The growing adoption of digitization has created the need to perform all real-world activities on digital platforms. So, it is expected that more participants would join the digital world using the tokenization process, which imparts security, transparency, and transaction efficiency. In the following article, we will discuss this topic more. Please stay tuned to understand more about tokenization, and feel free to write if you have any queries.© Thank You!

"What Is Hyperledger Sawtooth And Its Exclusive Benefits?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-hyperledger-sawtooth/","Blog Post","30/11/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Table of Contents • Characteristics of Sawtooth • Features of the Hyperledger Sawtooth • Benefits of the Hyperledger Sawtooth Are you curious what Hyperledger Sawtooth is? What are the features and advantages of Hyperledger Sawtooth? We will discuss these terms in this article. Let us start.The Linus Foundation developed Hyperledger Sawtooth to maintain ledgers truly distributed with enhanced security for smart contracts. This platform is suitable for customized smart contracts because of its open-source enterprise blockchain-as-a-service.Hyperledger Sawtooth’s user-friendly design gives a flawless performance for enterprise usage. In this system, developers kept the development layer and major network separated to ensure the best smooth experience in the development process. The core system remains unaffected during the development stage. The surge in resource sharing does not affect the core system. Programming languages like Go, C++, Python, JavaScript, Rust, etc., support the Hyperledger Sawtooth. It gives a wide range of exciting ways of implementing blockchain solutions or blockchain applications. Characteristics of Sawtooth Algorithms of Sawtooth Consensus The consensus algorithm lies at the heart of the stability of the blockchain architecture and, more broadly, public ledgers. The Sakamoto Consensus Algorithm [2] is the most traditional, and it solved the limitations of the Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) Consensus. PoET, PBFT, and Raft are three distinct consensus techniques provided by Hyperledger Sawtooth. PoET with Sawtooth Sawtooth Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) is a Nakamoto-style algorithm for huge network populations. To determine which node will add the next block, PoET employs a “fair lottery” mechanism: each node creates a random wait time during which nodes must sleep. The node with the shortest wait time will be first to wake up and win the lottery. This step allows a new block to the blockchain. PoET is, of course, more energy efficient because nodes are not wasting energy attempting to insert blocks. PBFT Sawtooth Sawtooth Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) is a voting-based consensus technique that provides Byzantine fault tolerance (updated version of the original PBFT [3]). It has the disadvantage of having an exponentially increasing message count as nodes are added to the set. The leader node proposed that a new block be added, and exchanged a series of messages among the nodes. The algorithm provides provable resistance to a percentage of malicious nodes, which varies depending on implementation. The Sawtooth Raft Raft is a consensus mechanism based on leaders that guarantees crash fault tolerance (CFT): the system’s keystone is the leader, who is considered to always act honestly. The leader’s blocks have not been forged, and its updates are reliable. The leader has a cohort of nodes that simply propagate the leader’s updates, and if the leader crashes after a given timeout, a new leader is elected from among the followers. This algorithm is naturally resistant to CFT. For example, on a six-node network, the quorum to elect a new leader is four (one more than half of the six available nodes). Raft is more efficient (also in terms of energy) than PBFT and PoET because there is no competition to add blocks among nodes, wasting CPU time; updates are simply propagated as long as the leader is active. Consensus in development mode Let us briefly present Sawtooth’s devmode consensus algorithm to help developers understand how to construct a consensus algorithm from scratch. Dev mode is, as you may have guessed, a consensus process that should only be used in development mode: it has no crash tolerance and employs a simple simplified random-leader selection. Additional information about these algorithms The techniques described above deviate from the traditional PoW consensus for several reasons: Unlike lottery-style consensus algorithms like as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Elapsed Time, Sawtooth is built for a scenario in which the collaboration between the blocks committed by nodes is definitive (PoET) Developers usually regarded pBFT as a non-scalable algorithm. Node server assumption should not occur when pBFT is used in production. pBFT should be utilized with a consortium of enterprise organizations, with each organization representing a network node organization. Each of these organizational nodes should then have clusters of instances and load balancers behind its endpoint to expand computational capacity and ensure fast response time. Features of the Hyperledger Sawtooth (1) Easier Application Development: The central core and application layers are not connected, making it easier to develop blockchain solutions without affecting the core.Another vital factor is the availability of a wide range of smart contracts. Business enterprises can select a preferred programming language and develop the application on it. (2) Private and Public Network: Sawtooth platform offers two variants of the blockchain as per the requirement. Users can develop both permissioned and permissionless access with this platform.The developing companies can provide either permissioned or permissionless access, which is not possible on other platforms. (3) Permissioning Features: It can solve all the issues related to the private blockchain in the Hyperledger Sawtooth. A detached permissioning option is available in every cluster of devices or nodes in the network.Nodes could not leak the sensitive information stored to outsiders. Every node needs an individual permissioning option assigned, ensuring a different level of clearance in every node. (4) Modular Structure: The Hyperledger Sawtooth offers a modular structure that is very easy to customize as per enterprise needs. Simply put, if the enterprise wants to use any foreign feature, they can just plugin and use it. (5) Parallel transaction execution: One of the crucial features of the Sawtooth is parallel transaction verification. This feature ensures the verification of various transactions simultaneously parallel to each other.In practical application, this feature minimizes the processing time by reducing the massive work pressure on the network. Benefits of the Hyperledger Sawtooth 1. Immutable Transaction History:One of the vital features of this platform is its immutable transaction history. At any given point in time, there is a cryptographic linkage of transactions that assures the state of information. These logs are auditable and readily available.Byzantine-fault tolerance: Another crucial benefit is Byzantine-fault tolerance. This tolerance means that the network does not stop working and remains productive, even though one of its nodes goes offline or crashes.The complete network does not crash even though some nodes face operation issues. The fault tolerance is excellent in this system. 2. Parallel Scheduling: Both parallel and serial scheduling of the transactions can be done using the Hyperledger Sawtooth. Productivity increases in parallel scheduling, and support in minimizing latency occurs in serial scheduling. 3. Multilanguage Support: many programming languages like C++, Python, Rust, and JavaScript, support smart contracts developed on the Hyperledger Sawtooth Go, etc. 4. Dynamic Consensus: Developers can easily change all the blockchain settings and consensus algorithms using Sawtooth.Energy Efficiency: Other blockchain networks use a proof-of-work consensus algorithm, whereas Sawtooth uses a proof-of-elapsed time consensus algorithm, making it energy-efficient. 5. Loose Coupling Architecture: In a Sawtooth network, blocks are not dependent on each other. Independent blocks mean the changes made in one block do not affect the network, decreasing the possibility of an unexpected error, and simplifying the testing and maintenance of the ledger. 6. Permissioned and permissionless: Sawtooth can be permissionless, which means anyone can interact with the network by submitting transactions. At the same time, it could be permissioned closed networks representing users who cannot freely join the distributed ledger system. 7. Loose coupling architecture: The blocks in this network are not dependent on each other. This feature minimizes the possibility of unexpected errors and simplifies the process of ledger maintenance and testing. 8. Events: The creation and broadcast of the events across the network are possible on the Sawtooth. Final Thoughts: The Hyperledger Sawtooth has distinct salient features than other blockchain networks. These features make it easy to implement in organizations dealing with healthcare, finance, retail, and other organizations to develop a safe, decentralized, and reliable environment for their operations.If you have queries about strategizing the solution for your organization, you can comment in the box below.

"What is Hash in Blockchain Technology?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-hash-in-blockchain-technology/","Blog Post","24/11/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Blockchain technology is emerging as a technological innovation in all industry sectors in recent years. The transactions and data stored on the blockchain network are immutable and secured with the adoption of Hash code to store data. The hash function ensures network security. The cryptographic hash function plays a crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem. Distributed ledger technology, including blockchain, uses hash functions to ensure the data. Exploring the concept of hashing is necessary to better understand how Bitcoin works. Let us start with the idea, other related terminologies, and hash types. Table of Contents • What does hash in blockchain mean? • Characteristics • Types • Uses In Blockchain Tech What does hash in blockchain mean? Hash in blockchain is a cryptography process for converting any data form into a unique text string. Irrespective of the type, scale, length, and size of the data, we can create a hash for any data piece of data. The output is a fixed-length string.With blockchain adopted for cryptocurrencies, it used a predetermined hashing algorithm for transactions of the same varying length. The length of input does not affect the process. Output is called a Hash. For example, Bitcoin uses the Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA 256). SHA 256 always gives out a fixed length with a 256-bits size (32 bytes). This process ensures easy tracing or recalling of the transactions. Hash size depends on the function decided. Simply put, a YouTube video of 50 megabytes and a text message of 10 kilobytes would have the same length of 256-bits. The difference would be in the hash pattern. Characteristics To secure any cryptographic function, developers use specific properties or characteristics in the hashing function. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin have unique hashing functions, differentiating them from other cryptocurrencies. Let us discuss these features. 1. Quick Computation: Quick computation for every input data plays a crucial role in blockchain technology. In simple words, hashing for any length must take the same time. For example, single word dog and entire novel should take the same duration for hashing function. 2. Deterministic: A specific or fixed output is necessary for a hash function. This process must create the same length or size irrespective of the number of transactions and input data length. Otherwise, different transactions would have other effects, making tracking transactions impossible. 3. Different hashes for every transaction: Hashing process creates different hashes for every input. For example, the hash for the words mirror and mirror1 would be different. These hashes would have similar patterns but differ at the end. 4. Pre-image resistance: One of the crucial characteristics of hashing is pre-image resistance. This characteristic makes it virtually impossible to determine the original input data from its hash. The only possible way of finding out the input data from the final hash is by generating all the hash combinations. But, it is not practically possible. Types Many hash algorithms, like Tiger, RipeMD, XXhash, etc., are used. The popular hash functions for file integrity are SHA-1, SHA-2, CRC32, MD5, etc. Let us discuss these hashes. SHA-2: The National Security Agency developed SHA-2. This family of hashes contains six functions with digests, i.e., hash values 224,256, 384, or 512 bits. We term these hashes SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-224, SHA-512/256. MD5: This hash function encodes a string of information into 128-bit fingerprints to verify data integrity. But, there is the possibility of hash collision vulnerability. Bcrypt: The dominant feature of Bcrypt is the password hashing function. As the computation speed is slower, it is susceptible to search attacks. Uses In Blockchain Tech Blockchain addresses use hashing. For example, Bitcoin addresses use RIPEMD160 and SHA2-256.Cryptographic signatures use hashing to determine the validity of transactions. A hash of transactions helps keep track of transactions on the blockchain. It is easier to search transaction hash in a blockchain explorer. In crypto mining, it plays a crucial role in forming consensus on the mechanism. It determines the speed of the mining process. It plays a pivotal role in deciding its difficulty level.A hash of data helps store a large volume of data on the blockchain. This data is time-stamped and valuable for future reference. The data need less storage space, thus economical. Final Thoughts: The cryptographic hash is crucial and integral to the blockchain system. It enhances the security capability of the processed transaction because of the immutability feature. Thus, it is beneficial in mobile/light wallets and deals with scalability issues.

"Blockchain Vs DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) Overview","https://blockchainshiksha.com/blockchain-vs-dlt/","Blog Post","22/11/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","The terms distributed ledger technology (DLT) and blockchain are often used interchangeably. In this article, we will discuss Blockchain Vs DLT. These days, blockchain, decentralization, and distributed ledger technology (DLT) are the most talked-about technologies. There are differences between these technologies. But they are interrelated also. Because a lack of knowledge creates confusion among technology enthusiasts, we expect both technologies to transform the world in the future. Before going into details, let’s discuss these terms in brief. Table of Contents • Blockchain Vs DLT • Difference Between DLT and Blockchain • Applications of DLT and Blockchain • Why does everyone want to compare blockchain and distributed ledgers? • Advantages of DLT and Blockchain Implementation Several nodes or computers exist in the distributed ledger, a distributed database across these devices. A ledger is maintained on each node and independently records every data change on each node. Each node verifies the transaction using a voting or consensus algorithm. However, the participation of all nodes or consensus mechanisms can depend on the rights granted. In simple words, sometimes all nodes will participate in the process, and sometimes only a few with permission will process the change in the database. Once all permissioned nodes give a go-ahead signal, DLT records a transaction in the ledger, and all nodes might receive an update message. This feature is one of the primary advantages of this technology, as it ensures transparency. No single authority governing distributed ledger technology provides a great deal of security. Nodes have time to verify the transaction verification, resulting in zero chance of corruption in the ledger. Industries like the financial industry are adopting this technology and gaining popularity because of its transparency. Blockchain Vs DLT What is a Distributed ledger? A distributed ledger is the parent technology of blockchain. The popularity of blockchain technology has increased more than the core concept of distributed ledger technology. Blockchain does not have a central governing authority. This feature means all the nodes have their copy of the ledger. Each new transaction gets updated automatically. Transactions are encrypted before being stored in the ledger. Blockchain networks are entirely decentralized, with strict computational protocols for computational trust. They store data as blocks that are linked with each other. Only adding operations are allowed in the blockchain, which means the data cannot be deleted or edited once entered. Every transaction on that blockchain remains in the history of that chain. What is Blockchain? Blockchain is a kind of distributed ledger. Every distributed ledger is not a blockchain. For instance, Dalda is the first brand in India that introduce hydrogenated vegetable cooking oil. But, still today, people use the word Dalda synonymously with vegetable ghee. One of the crucial differences between DLT and blockchain is the method of achieving consensus. There are various ways for consensus in the blockchain, including Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). But, with DLT, a consensus is essential. Difference Between DLT and Blockchain 1. Block Structure: In the case of the distributed ledger, the database is structured over various nodes. They used multiple ways to represent the data in each ledger. Whereas in a blockchain, data is stored as immutable blocks. 2. Sequence: There is no particular sequence of data in the case of a distributed ledger. In this manner, a blockchain differs from a distributed ledger. Data blocks are arranged in a specific sequence. 3. Power Hungry Consensus or Proof of Work: Distributed ledgers are more scalable. Power-hungry consensus algorithms and other forms of consensus are necessary for blockchain. This blockchain consensus is beyond traditional DLTs, thus gaining popularity. 4. Real-Life Implementations: Blockchain implementation in real-life projects is more straightforward, thus catching the attention of developers. Big technology giants like Alibaba, Oracle, and IBM offer clients blockchain solutions. Many distributed ledger variants are available but still need to be developed because of fewer real-life implementations. 5. Tokens: Tokens or currencies are not part of the DLT. For anti-spamming activities, these tokens are beneficial. Anyone can establish a node for blockchain. Even though modern blockchain systems are trying to come out of cryptocurrency setup, most blockchain systems use some tokens or cryptocurrencies. Tokens and associated smart contracts play an essential role in blockchain technology. Applications of DLT and Blockchain We can find a large variety of blockchains in various industries. First-ever cryptocurrency in the world, Bitcoin, is based on a blockchain platform. After the success and establishment of Bitcoins and altcoins, the blockchain is being adopted by many other industries apart from the crypto and financial industry. Distributed ledgers like R3 Corda, IBM Fabric, and Digital Asset Holdings are popular applications using distributed ledgers. Why does everyone want to compare blockchain and distributed ledgers? The most important characteristic of blockchain vs. DLT is its openness to innovations and ideas. The Crypto and finance sectors are launching innovative products and projects every day, and these technologies are becoming more and more enjoyable. Altcoins like Solana, Litecoin, Ethereum, etc., are like Bitcoin. They are gaining popularity as open-source projects. Advantages of DLT and Blockchain Implementation The decentralization of nodes is one of the most significant advantages of DLTs. It eliminates the prominent intermediary from the network and ensures control over information and user flow. Transparency is a necessity in many industries, including banking and finance. Billions of transactions can be handled using distributed ledgers with transparency. The speed of transaction processing is much more than the traditional database systems. In the case of cryptocurrency, transparency is allowed using blockchain, as each transaction can be visible publicly. The data and transactions are secured. Every addition of data passes through security checks, and the activity log is stored in the blockchain. Smart contract algorithms ensure high-level encryption to create a tamper-proof environment. Final Thoughts: I hope you have a clear idea about the difference between the two technologies, blockchain, and DLT. DLTs differ from blockchains in terms of architecture, but the basic idea is the same. Blockchain is a distributed ledger backed by cryptocurrencies. Technology enthusiasts believe that digital currency and decentralization can solve many existing problems in the finance industry. If you have queries, please reach out.

"Defi KYC: Need and Significance to build Trust on Defi","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-defi-kyc/","Blog Post","09/11/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","If you have basic knowledge of Defi means, you might wonder what Defi KYC is. In this article, we will discuss the importance of Defi KYC. Let us start with the concept of Defi in brief. What does Defi mean? Decentralized finance, or Defi, is a public decentralized blockchain network where financial products are available for investors. Blockchain-based Defi software enables peer-to-peer transactions for lenders, borrowers, buyers, and sellers. It eliminates the need for a middle for performing transactions.KYC mean Know Your Customer, Which is the process of authentication. Why is Defi KYC necessary? The universe of Defi is rapidly expanding, with new projects revealed every month. When the world was first introduced with decentralized finance, it aimed to open up new doors in the financial sector by providing banking services to 1.7 billion unbanked people. However, despite its rapid growth, the investor acceptance rate in Defi is low due to fraud and a lack of protection. In the financial sector, the protection of investments and investors is critical. The Defi introduces new solutions such as project audits and “know your customer” (KYC) initiatives to protect projects and typical investors. Know-Your-Customer (KYC) ensures that Defi providers collect and record as much information about their investors to stop money laundering and other fraudulent financial activity.The project auditing procedure examines the smart contracts and assesses the project’s risk. The combination of these methods provides investors and Defi projects with security. Importance of Defi KYC and why it is necessary 1. Trust Building on Defi: The audit and KYC combination is critical in establishing trust in the Defi system and current and future Defi projects. The Defi system is still in its early stages of development. In contrast to client trust in the old financial framework, it must build investor trust. A project audit is conducted before the project’s debut to assure investors of the project’s trustworthiness. For simple accessibility and openness in Defi, the audit reports are usually placed on the upcoming project website. When investors’ faith in Defi projects and the Defi space grows, it will eventually encourage them to invest in Defi projects and the Defi space. 2. Auditing: In the crypto realm, auditing ongoing and forthcoming projects is critical. In the case of all new computer programs, the risks of coding issues are higher. If the project’s coding contains an error, it will directly influence the investor’s security and project financing. If the code is not correctly secured, hackers will be more likely to steal funds from investors. There’s also the possibility of assets being accidentally locked in smart contracts. It’s expected that the assets or tokens will never be recovered, resulting in a loss for the typical investor. Auditing the projects is required to assure complete safety for the investors. 3. Protection from Financial Fraud: In recent years, the fraud related to crypto-assets has increased. Due to the KYC procedure, it would be an easier task to trace the malicious intentions of the investors. KYC gathers the investor data and can stop the individuals from committing fraudulent acts like scamming other users’ accounts. Importance of the Defi KYC: 1. Restrict the chances of money laundering 2. Protect the Defi project from legal issues related to financial fraud, like money laundering issues, tax, etc 3. Minimizes the participation of scammers in the token offerings, thereby protecting the project from the first stage 4. It covers the project, existing or upcoming, with a negative reputation. Regulatory Authority for Defi KYC FATF’s (Global Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Watchdog) attention has been drawn to the popularity and application of Defi use cases due to the surge in Defi platforms and solutions. Even though FATF is not a regulatory body, it has established standards for using Defi solutions with KYC.The FATF rules are intended to serve as examples for national governments regarding legislation. It highlights the use of Defi in conjunction with KYC to combat the use of Defi instruments for money laundering and other criminal activities. In conclusion, weak KYC could impact the safety norms of the Defi projects, and investors could fall prey to the spammer’s attacks. Defi KYC is essential for raising funds using the Defi platform and increasing investors’ trust in this platform. Team Blockchain Shiksha.© Thank You! Related","[Cryptocurrency]","NULL"
"What Makes Kava Defi a Promising Investment option?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-makes-kava-defi-a-promising-investment-option/","Blog Post","07/11/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","You’ve probably heard of the Kava platform if you’re a Defi investor. But, before you learn about Kava, you’ll want to know a bit about this platform. We’ll talk about what Kava is and how it works in this article. What is the Kava Platform? Kava is a next-generation decentralized lending platform to increase market flexibility. It enables participants to lend and mortgage assets without the assistance of a traditional financial intermediary. The majority of Defi projects use Ethereum. However, Kava uses Cosmos since it claims to add more functionality and capacity. Kava uses a Cosmos feature called zones to govern the crypto assets it accepts. This feature illustrates a network of several different blockchains working together. This protocol also aids projects in expanding the number of cryptocurrency assets available to borrowers, such as Binance (#BNB), Ripple (#XRP), and Bitcoin (#BTC) (BTC). The Kava Defi platform functions as a decentralized cryptocurrency bank. The users of the Kava platform can access various financial services like native US-dollar-pegged derivatives and stablecoin USDX. The users can deposit collateral and borrow USDX, which helps leverage their exposure to cryptocurrency assets. How does Kava work? USDX can be used as collateral for crypto assets by Kava network users. USDX serves as a stablecoin for Kava. By securing their crypto in a smart contract, users can acquire USDX loans on the network. Users can also create synthetic leverage for any crypto asset that has been funded. They will need to take out many collateralized loans to do this. The protocol can also safeguard a user’s BTC or XRP assets. They will be given an equal number of freshly produced USDX in exchange, which they can use to buy additional bitcoin. Users gain from a market-leveraged position as a result. Kava also takes advantage of a variety of community-developed applications. These Dapps can benefit from the platform’s overall UX. The interoperability feature of the Dapps allows investors to store their assets using a range of institutional-goal custodians and hardware wallets. What is Kava Token? Kava Token is a Kava Network native token with a total quantity of 122 million coins. The majority of these coins are utilized for staking and governance. Kava holders can vote on proposals to change the framework or blockchain settings from a governance standpoint. The voting rights granted for a company’s equity stock are equivalent to these votes.Staking rights allow Kava owners to distribute voting rights to validators to preserve the network. Validators are compensated through stability fees and transaction fees collected from users. The industry experts predict the price of the Kava token will reach $104 by the year 2030. Features of the Kava. 1. Stablecoin Hedging + Interest: Investors can stake and bond USDX stablecoin on the Kava platform and start earning a healthy passive income. 2. Decentralized Loans and Leverage: Decentralized loans are the main product of the Kava platform. The Kava users gain open access to leverage, loans, and stablecoin for Hedging. This feature is increasing the popularity of the Kava platform. 3. Expansion: Open architecture of the Kava supports a wide range of new crypto assets. New products are expected to be launched in the future. 4. Dual Tokens: Dual token strategy ensures that each investor gains maximum usability and flexibility. Due to this strategy, investors and developers can maximize their functionality without detracting from either sector. Two critical coins to Kava are KAVA and USDX. Kava functions: Kava functions as a governance token in this blockchain ecosystem. These tokens must vote on critical parameters and guide the network’s upgrades. The token holders can use tokens for proposals and voting on important parameters like the collateralized debt position system (CDP). Staking Asset: Aside from the security of the blockchain, the users can stake their holdings by utilizing the bonding curves of network validators. Kava platform is famous for its zero-tolerance of malicious nodes. Security: In the Kava system, an algorithm determines the top token holders and examines each investor’s weighted bonded stake in Kava tokens. Stakers earn crypto as block rewards. USDX-Kava: USDX is the financial instrument that an investor receives and pays back at the time of the loan. It increases the transaction time and makes it most suitable for payrolls and other corporate payments. Hedging with Interest: Investors can acquire USDX as a stablecoin that is considered a haven in market volatility. USDX holders earn the accumulated interest equal to the current USDX savings rate. Margin Trading or Leverage: Skilled investors can efficiently leverage their funds to purchase additional cryptos in their portfolios. Final Thoughts: Kava platform offers many opportunities to investors to earn significant rewards and enjoy a passive income. Kava is considered a substantial contender in the Defi sector as this platform is secured. If you have more queries about the Kava platform, please comment below.© Thank You!

"How does VeChain Blockchain Good for Supply Chain Management?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-vechain-blockchain/","Blog Post","31/10/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Do you intend to implement a blockchain ecosystem in supply chain management? Then, the VeChain blockchain (VET) is the best option for you. This article will see what VeChain is and how it works. What is VeChain Blockchain? VeChain is the first blockchain designed specifically for the needs of business clients. Distributed ledger technology improves the supply chain and effectively manages the product lifetime (DLT). This platform is excellent for companies looking to improve their procedures and supply chain protocols by implementing new features. VeChain’s distributed ledger allows for efficient collaboration, transparent data interchange, and high-speed value transactions. An asymmetric information problem primarily plagues the logistics industry. Even though the current system collects a large amount of data, data communication is not optimal. Due to excessive compartmentalization, the entire supply chain’s reliance on centralized data sources grows—the lack of unity results in delayed data transmission and lack of transparency. The Usefulness of VeChain in business applications A business enterprise can implement the VeChain platform to authenticate the quality, transport medium, storage temperature, and last-mile delivery of an alcohol bottle or medicine pack. The platform uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) or smart chips and sensors to broadcast the information on the blockchain network by authorized stakeholders on a real-time basis.Due to the installation of the sensors, the source can monitor all the product parameters and communicate with stakeholders instantly. In the above case, if the medicine is stocked at a different temperature than the prescribed temperature, the system informs the manufacturer and customers of service enhancement and quality control. Let us now discuss how VeChain works. VeChain uses many technologies to achieve the goals in supply chain management. The use of RFID and sensors help in monitoring critical data in large supply chains. The stakeholders and market players can keep track of the product’s condition and authenticity. It also keeps the business up to date on the developments. VeChain is the first technology in the integration of DLT and IoT technologies. The Internet of Things is a network of smart devices located in different locations. VeChainThor blockchain is intended for mass business adoption using a public blockchain. Two tokens are available in this blockchain, namely, VET and VTHO. Transactions in decentralized applications use VET on VeChains blockchains. VET is used for carrying value or smart money through smart contracts. VTHO tokens or VeChainThor Energy or VeThor Energy are used to add value to the transactions on the VeChain. It is equivalent to the cost of transaction cost on its blockchain.Two token systems are adopted for effective governance and a predictable economic model for decentralized developers. Some critical use cases of VeChain's technology 1. Anti-Counterfeiting: Counterfeiting is one of the most severe issues in the luxury goods industry. A chip is embedded in the premium item in this situation. This chip is then utilized to track and log logistical, maintenance, warehousing, and resale information. Even after selling and purchasing the item again, the owner can track it down and ensure its authenticity. 2. Food Safety: More transparent food economy can be established using blockchain-based solutions. The business enterprise can use IoT devices and VeChain to transport vehicles, products, and warehouses across the supply chain. VeChainThor blockchain would receive location and environmental data using these devices. This collected data can b uploaded, verified, and stored in a decentralized and tamper-proof manner. Many companies adopt this system, like Shenzhen Yuhongtai Foods. 3. Carbon Emission Tracking: IoT devices can be installed in carbon-emitting activities. Consumers can be involved in a carbon-saving scheme. Consumers can be offered some credits when they generate less carbon. VeChain solution is already implemented by BYD, a Chinese electric car brand. 4. Health Records: Healthcare records can be stored on the blockchain instead of inefficient and insecure record systems for lab results. Administrators can give access to authorized parties and patients for the data. This data ld be given to authorized parties and patients. In 2021, the Mediterranean Hospital of Cyprus and Aretaeio Hospital had rolled out the VeChain-based E-HCert app. 5. VeChain – Creating its path: In blockchain technology, VeChain is gaining popularity. This platform increases the boundaries of blockchain efficiency, offering more advanced alternatives to business processes. Practical blockchain applications can be prepared using VeChain. Final Thoughts: Day by day, the popularity of blockchain implementation is growing. If you have any queries about VeChain, please comment in the box given below.

"Why Is the Metaverse gaining Industry Expert’s attention?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-the-metaverse/","Blog Post","26/10/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Have you heard about Metaverse yet? Why are BigTech businesses and other online platforms gearing up to take the Metaverse’s place in the industry? This article will explain the Metaverse and why it is so popular. What is the Metaverse? The simple answer to this question is that it does not exist. It is a futuristic technology in which our business and personal lives would run concurrently with our physical lives. In the coming years, this technology has the potential to bring tremendous changes. The Metaverse will focus on a variety of emerging and established technologies. Its initial focus could be on digital meeting spaces, virtual reality, gaming, digital assets such as non-tangible tokens, brain-machine interfaces, etc. This technology may expand when data from the physical world is connected via the internet of things (IoT). It will link businesses and people, allowing for physical and digital coexistence. Characteristics of the Metaverse. 1. Synchronicity: Metaverse participants could interact with the digital world and among themselves in real-time. The interconnection between participants would resemble their way in the physical world. 2. Persistence: Irrespective of place and time, Metaverse will exist. 3. Availability: Many users can log in at the same with no capping for a maximum number 4. Interoperability: Participants of Metaverse can use their virtual items for various experiences. For example, users can use a cloth bought using Metaverse in different concerts, games, and other virtual environments. Whenever the Metaverse starts its application for business purposes, like ID verification, data exchange, etc., it will change its techniques. 5. Economy: Business participants will be able to perform transactions like the supply of services and goods in exchange for the value determined by others. The value for the exchange of the Metaverse may include cryptocurrency, non-fungible tokens, e-money, traditional fiat money, etc. In the future, technologies like smart contracts, distributed ledgers, etc., will be implemented to exchange value. What is the difference between World Wide Web and Metaverse? At the time of any internet interaction, a specific server communicates with another on an as-needed basis or the user’s device. Even though users experience simultaneous interactions at the time of communication, these transactions are performed at intervals of a fraction of seconds. In terms of user interaction and experience, Metaverse will perform the interactions simultaneously in video calls for better user interaction and experience. In simple words, it will follow many-to-many communication. Various infrastructures are necessary to implement the Metaverse on a decentralized or distributed basis. In the future, users might adapt existing Internet infrastructure technologies like cloud computing, distributed ledger technology, etc., for Metaverse. Potential Legal Issues After adopting the Metaverse, we expect various regulatory and complex problems. Let us discuss these issues. Data: Metaverse involves gathering unprecedented types and amounts of personal data. In today’s era, websites and smartphone apps collect the data that internet users browse. After adopting the Metaverse, the organizations could collect information about the internet user’s physiological movements, brainwave patterns, and responses. They can judge the customer’s behavior patterns and possessions. The users’ behavior would be monitored continuously, ensuring the service providers deliver more customized services. For example, if a participant in the Metaverse is looking at a sweet mart display or a restaurant, the tool would recognize that the participant is hungry and show the advertisements appropriate for hungry people. The need to input personal data would be eliminated, and it would collect data using a background environment. Different legal entities have several kinds of data protection laws. The question arises, who will take the security of the user’s data, who will administer the data collected, etc. Consent to Marketing: In many countries, the customer’s approval is required to market the products. They secured them with data protection laws. Metaverse will send the advertisements to the customers browsing the shelves in the store. It would decide the promotions because of the past product choice of the products. For Example: In the case of information about kids, parental consent is needed under data protection law. In many countries, this law bars the organizations from using the kid’s data for marketing to ensure the kids’ safety. Data Sharing: The collected data can pass through different channels and platforms to ensure flawless services. This process would enhance the interoperability, and customers could adopt more digital assets. But for this purpose, brands and developers must establish multilateral or bilateral data-sharing agreements for an excellent consumer experience. For example, some data protection laws require that users know how and where their data would be used. This condition will increase the difficulty level of implementing the Metaverse. Data Export and localization: One of the crucial features of the Metaverse is its seamless transition to the data. It would be a challenging task to manage the speed with no disturbance. Some countries restrict the transfer of their citizen’s data out of the country. Like any other online platform, on the forum also, the risk of data breaches and cyber-attacks exists. Final Thoughts: Metaverse would increase the way of marketing as it will approach the participants based on the external environment of the targeted customer. Despite many advantages, it involves the risk associated with data breaches and cyber-attacks. For more updates about the Metaverse, please stay connected with Blockchain Shiksha.© Thank You!

"The Ultimate Guide to Understanding What Altcoins Are and the Different Types","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-are-altcoins/","Blog Post","10/10/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Welcome to the fascinating world of altcoins, where innovation and experimentation collide with the world of cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin carved its path as the pioneer of digital currencies, a new wave of alternative coins emerged, offering unique features, functionalities, and investment opportunities. These altcoins, short for “alternative coins,” have gained significant traction in the crypto market, attracting both seasoned investors and curious newcomers. In this blog, we will explore the diverse landscape of altcoins and delve into their various types, like stablecoins, privacy coins, security tokens, utility tokens, exchange tokens, etc. each with its own characteristics and potential for revolutionizing the financial landscape. Join us as we navigate the exciting realm of altcoins and unlock their secrets. What are altcoins? After the success of Bitcoin, market players have launched alternative cryptocurrencies. These alternate cryptocurrencies are termed altcoins. Market participants consider these coins a better replacement for Bitcoins. Issuers of altcoins always try to overcome the drawbacks of Bitcoins. Two words, alt and coin, form the term altcoin. Alt refers to alternatives, and coins mean cryptocurrency. Altcoins are a separate category of digital coins alternative to the digital Bitcoin currency. Some altcoins differ from bitcoins in consensus mechanisms to validate transactions or create blocks. Proof-of-stake consensus used by some altcoins intends to minimize the time required for block creation and energy consumption to validate new transactions. Some altcoins have low price volatility or smart contracts with more secured predetermined terms. Various types of Altcoins. Based on the different consensus mechanisms and functionalities, they categorize altcoins into four types. One altcoin might fall into over one category. 1 Stablecoins: Stablecoins are a specific class of altcoins designed to minimize price volatility. They achieve this stability by being pegged to an external reserve, typically a fiat currency or a commodity like gold. Stablecoins offer a reliable and secure investment option, maintaining a relatively constant value, making them popular for transactions and risk management. Stablecoins, among the various types of altcoins, have gained immense popularity for several reasons: 1 Price Stability: Stablecoins maintain a stable value by being pegged to an external asset, typically a fiat currency or a commodity. This stability makes them an attractive choice for storing value and conducting transactions without exposure to the volatile nature of other cryptocurrencies. 2 Easy to Use: Stablecoins function similarly to traditional digital currencies, facilitating seamless and efficient transactions. They can be sent and received across borders quickly and at lower costs than conventional banking systems. Additionally, stablecoins often integrate with existing blockchain platforms, allowing for easy integration into various decentralized applications. 3. Risk Management: Stablecoins provide a hedging mechanism within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Traders and investors can conveniently move their funds into stablecoins during market instability or uncertainty, mitigating potential losses—this ability to quickly convert into stable asset safeguards against market downturns. When considering stablecoins as an investment option, it is crucial to evaluate certain factors: Transparency: Look for stablecoins issued by reputable entities that provide transparent information about their underlying reserves, audit reports, and regular disclosures of the assets backing the stablecoin. Regulatory Compliance: Choose stablecoins that comply with relevant regulations and adhere to legal frameworks. This compliance helps establish trust and ensures the long-term viability of the stablecoin. Market Adoption: Consider stablecoins that have achieved significant market adoption and liquidity. Higher adoption and liquidity indicate greater ease of use and a higher likelihood of maintaining the stablecoin’s peg to its underlying asset. Technology and Security: Evaluate the underlying technology of the stablecoin. Consider factors such as the blockchain network it operates on, the security of its smart contracts, and the system’s overall stability. Robust security measures are crucial to protect against potential hacks or vulnerabilities. Established Track Record: Look for stablecoins with a proven track record of maintaining their peg to the underlying asset over a sustained period. Historical performance can provide insights into the stability and reliability of the stablecoin. Privacy Coin: Privacy coins are cryptocurrencies specifically designed to enhance the privacy and anonymity of transactions. Unlike traditional cryptos like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which operate on public ledgers where transaction details are visible to anyone, privacy coins utilize advanced cryptographic techniques to protect user identities and transaction information. The primary feature of privacy coins is the obfuscation of transaction data. They employ techniques like ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions to hide the sender, recipient, and transaction amount. These features make tracing or linking transactions to specific individuals extremely challenging, preserving users’ privacy. Another key aspect of privacy coins is the optional nature of privacy. While transactions are generally private by default, privacy coins often allow users to choose whether to make their transactions transparent or shielded. This flexibility ensures compatibility with regulatory requirements and user preferences, making privacy coins a versatile financial tool. Privacy coins also emphasize decentralization and community governance. Many privacy coins aim to be community-driven, where important decisions are made through consensus, reducing the influence of central authorities and promoting user empowerment. Overall, privacy coins offer enhanced privacy and anonymity, giving individuals greater control over their financial transactions and fostering a more confidential and secure digital economy. Utility tokens: Utility tokens are a type of digital token that represents a unit of value within a specific blockchain ecosystem or platform. These tokens are designed to provide access to specific products, services, or features the blockchain project or platform offers. The significance of utility tokens lies in their ability to enable various functionalities within a blockchain ecosystem. Here are a few key points: Access to Services: Utility tokens are often used to access and utilize specific services or products within a blockchain network. For example, they can be used to pay transaction fees, access premium features, or obtain certain privileges. Incentives and Rewards: Utility tokens can encourage user participation and engagement within the platform. Projects can stimulate user activity and create a thriving ecosystem by offering rewards or discounts as tokens. Governance and Voting: In some cases, utility tokens grant holders the right to partake in the governance and decision-making processes of the blockchain project. Token holders can vote on proposals, suggest changes, or influence the direction of the platform’s development. Crowdfunding and Token Sales: Many blockchain projects launch initial coin offerings (ICOs) or token sales to fund their development. By offering utility tokens, projects can raise capital from investors who believe in the project’s potential and want to gain access to its future products or services. Liquidity and Trading: Utility tokens are often traded on cryptocurrency exchanges, allowing holders to buy, sell, or trade them. This feature provides liquidity and the potential for price appreciation, allowing investors to benefit from the success and adoption of the underlying platform. It’s important to note that utility tokens should not be confused with security tokens, which represent ownership in an asset or company and are subject to securities regulations. Utility tokens primarily focus on providing access and utility within a specific ecosystem rather than functioning as an investment instrument. However, regulatory frameworks can vary across jurisdictions, so it’s crucial to comply with applicable laws and regulations when dealing with utility tokens. Security tokens: Security tokens are digital tokens that represent ownership or investment in a real-world asset, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or commodities. Unlike utility tokens, which provide access to a product or service, security tokens are designed to comply with securities regulations, providing investors with certain rights and protections. Here are some key features of security tokens: Regulation and Compliance: Security tokens are subject to securities laws and regulations varying across jurisdictions. They must comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements, verifying investors’ identities and preventing illicit activities. Asset Backing: Each security token is backed by a real-world asset, meaning investors have a claim on the underlying asset’s value. This feature enhances transparency and can provide additional stability compared to purely speculative tokens. Ownership and Governance: Security tokens represent ownership or equity in an asset or project. Holders of security tokens typically enjoy various rights, such as voting rights, dividends, profit sharing, and liquidation preferences, depending on the terms set by the issuing entity. Fractional Ownership and Liquidity: Security tokens enable fractional ownership, allowing investors to purchase a fraction of an asset. This feature opens up investment opportunities to a wider range of participants. Additionally, security tokens can enhance liquidity by enabling peer-to-peer trading on compliant secondary market platforms, reducing traditional market barriers. Transparency and Auditability: Blockchain technology underlies security tokens, providing an immutable and transparent record of ownership and transactions. This feature enables efficient auditing and reduces the potential for fraud or manipulation. Automation and Efficiency: Security tokens can streamline various processes, such as capital raising, dividend distribution, and shareholder voting through smart contracts. This automation reduces administrative costs and increases efficiency. Global Accessibility: Security tokens can be issued and traded globally, removing geographical barriers and increasing access to investment opportunities. This democratization of investment can benefit both issuers and investors. It’s important to note that the regulatory landscape for security tokens is still evolving, and the specific features and requirements may vary depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the underlying asset. Consult legal and financial professionals before engaging in security token investments or issuances. Exchange tokens refer to digital assets or cryptocurrencies designed and launched to be used as a medium of exchange. They are typically decentralized and operate on a blockchain or distributed ledger technology. The significance of exchange tokens lies in their potential to revolutionize traditional financial systems. Here are some key points: Decentralization: Exchange tokens are often built on decentralized networks, such as blockchain, which means they are not controlled by any central authority like banks or governments. This decentralization offers increased transparency, security, and trust in transactions. Peer-to-Peer Transactions: Exchange tokens enable direct peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. This feature removes barriers and reduces costs associated with traditional financial systems like banks or payment processors. Global Accessibility: Exchange tokens can potentially equip financial services to the unbanked or underbanked, particularly in developing countries. As long as individuals have internet access, they can participate in the exchange of these tokens. Financial Inclusion: Exchange tokens can facilitate financial inclusion by enabling access to financial services for individuals who may not have access to traditional banking systems. They can help people store value, make transactions, and access financial services like loans or investments. Innovation and Disruption: Exchange tokens have catalyzed innovation in the fintech sector. They have opened up new possibilities for decentralized applications (DApps), smart contracts, and programmable money. They have also spurred the development of alternative fundraising methods, such as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) or Security Token Offerings (STOs). However, it’s essential to note that the regulatory landscape surrounding exchange tokens varies across countries. Governments and regulatory bodies are still adapting and defining rules to ensure consumer protection, prevent money laundering, and address potential risks associated with these assets. As a result, the significance and legal status of exchange tokens can differ depending on the jurisdiction.

"What is Crypto Wallet? How to choose Appropriate Wallet?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-wallet/","Blog Post","03/10/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Are you a crypto investor looking for a suitable #crypto wallet to store your coins? Then, in this essay, we’ll go through the different types of crypto wallets and their benefits and drawbacks. The secret keys for accessing the blockchain distributed ledgers are kept in crypto wallets. These keys are used to validate transactions in the same way digital signatures are used. However, in the case of cryptocurrencies, their function extends much beyond that of a storage facility. What is Crypto Wallet? A crypto wallet is a software that allows you to keep track of your private keys. Secret keys are necessary to authenticate the ownership of digital assets when validating crypto transactions. The cryptocurrency ecosystem relies heavily on these keys. The keys to a crypto wallet can be compared to the keys to a car. Keys are required to run the crypto wallet, just as they must drive a car. How do these crypto wallets work? Digital wallets, including crypto wallets, keep track of encrypted keys and store the blockchain address where a particular asset belongs. If the owner of the digital assets loses its address, they will lose control over their digital money and other assets as well. There are two crypto wallets: hardware wallets and software wallets. Hardware wallets: Hardware wallets are also termed cold storage as users can download and store transactions on hardware like smartphones or USB drives. Like Ledger and Trezor, vendors provide devices with preloaded software as cold storage wallets. Dash QT and Exodus.io are the two popular cold storage wallets. Cold wallets are divided into crypto-assist types of wallets. These wallets only handle the keys and signing of arbitrary data. This wallet is also called a hardware security module (HSMs). Some wallets can handle the generation and signing of complete transactions entering the distributed ledger network. Software wallets: They are also known as hot storage wallets. These wallets are accessible using an internet service like Coinbase. Large cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase provide the facility of online wallets for crypto holders. The hot wallets are classified as paper wallet generators and can be printed or rendered as QR codes. Which is a more Secure Wallet: A hot or Cold Wallet? Cold storage wallet is regarded as a more secure wallet than a hot wallet as there is no internet connection. As per historical data, cryptocurrency attacks happen when a hacker targets an online wallet service. Cyber attacks were made when the user inserted the secret keys into their wallet, especially while transferring the associated funds. For example: In 2014, Mt. Gox, the Japanese online crypto exchange, was attacked, which resulted in the theft of 850000 Bitcoins worth more than $450 million. Similarly, in 2018, Coincheck, a bitcoin exchange service, lost almost $1 billion in cryptocurrencies from its hot wallet service. In most cases, attackers steal funds from cryptocurrency blockchain by taking over the customer’s accounts. Because of this reason, it is not advisable to store cryptocurrency balances in online wallets. Industry experts advise keeping secret keys on a hardware wallet and having its hard copy on paper as a backup to safeguard the secret keys. Investors must understand why it is essential to keep keys secured, as most attacks are made by stealing the keys. In the past, centralized wallet services were the lucrative targets for hackers, and they stole millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency in a few minutes. They have also targeted phone-based wallets by stealing SIM card identities. Hackers have also used malware placed on crypto owners’ phones for the theft of cryptocurrency. What happens if a crypto owner loses their secret keys? If a crypto owner with a cold wallet does not back up the information in hard copy or secure it properly and loses the device, in that case, they lose their digital assets because of negligence. In the case of cold storage, there are minimal methods to recover the lost private keys. These techniques are not very easy to use. For example, Coinbase provides a recovery system that comprises 24 random words recovery phrases. The wallets are expected to record this phrase at the time of the creation of the wallet. Whereas, in the case of hot storage, the added advantage of service provider support exists. If a crypto investor loses their access code, service providers have challenges-and questions for recovery. As all the cryptocurrency transactions are executed on a trustless consensus mechanism, they do not recognize the person or transacting party. This system only trusts transactions adequately signed with a valid secret key. Crypto wallets: Other uses beyond digital currency Most crypto wallets are used for storing cryptocurrencies like Ripple, Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin. But this software can also record keys to non-fungible and fungible digital tokens representing financial assets, goods, securities, and services. For example, a token in a crypto wallet can represent any asset with a digital value attached to it. The token can represent the unique artwork, plane tickets, concert tickets, or goods in a supply chain. In the future, based on the crypto wallets backed by blockchain technology, a new and trustless global economy might emerge. These wallets might represent everything from professional histories, individual financial data, medical information, tax information, consumer preference, corporate employee data, digital signatures, etc. In conclusion, hot and cold storage crypto wallets have their own pros and cons. Hot crypto wallets are gaining popularity because the service provider supports recovering the lost secret key. Investors are also inclined towards cold storage to safeguard themselves from hackers.

"How to select crypto exchange? Things you should know","https://blockchainshiksha.com/crypto-exchange-pros-cons/","Blog Post","28/09/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","In a previous article, we briefly discussed the phrase Crypto exchange. We’ll look at how crypto exchanges work and the different sorts of crypto exchanges. Let’s get this party started. Cryptocurrencies have been causing a stir throughout the world and revolutionizing the Fintech business. Investors should learn everything there is to know about cryptocurrency exchanges before investing in cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency exchanges are vital in the blockchain development sector. The cryptocurrency exchange acts as a middleman between buyers and sellers, allowing them to swap cryptos instantly. The parties involved in the transaction swap their cryptos for fiat and digital currencies. They have registered at least 20 cryptos on the cryptocurrency exchange for smooth and well-established transactions. Multi-functionality exchanges are preferred by investors who want to generate high-end dividends from their assets. What is Crypto Exchange? A cryptocurrency exchange is a mediator, like a brokerage firm between a seller and buyer of cryptocurrency. Investors can deposit money for transactions using modes of payments like debit or credit cards, UPI, direct bank transfers, etc. The exchanges charge transaction fees or commissions for every trade executed. An investor should research the exchange for their needs. They must explore the exchange’s credibility, history, and trading benefits. The main types of crypto exchanges are centralized cryptocurrency exchange (#CEX) and decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (#DEX). Centralized Cryptocurrency Exchange (CEX) Centralized exchanges are the third parties between a seller and a buyer. The company operates and controls the centralized cryptocurrency exchange to offer more reliability. Amongst the total number of cryptocurrency transactions, almost 99% of trades go through centralized exchanges. Popular centralized exchanges are GDAX, Gemini, Coinbase, Kraken, etc. Pros of Centralized Exchange: 1. User-Friendly: Centralized exchanges are gaining popularity as they offer a friendly way of investing and trading in cryptocurrencies. Using the centralized exchange is simple. Investors can log in to their accounts to make transactions and view account balances through websites and applications. 2. Reliable: The centralized exchanges offer an extra layer of reliability and security for trading and transactions. As it entirely developed these platforms, they provide more comfort to investors Cons of Centralized Exchange: 1. Risk of Hacking: Centralized crypto exchanges have the holdings of the investors. Usually, these holdings are worth millions of dollars. The chances of hackers attacking are more in centralized crypto exchanges. For example, before the theft, Mt Gox was the world’s largest crypto exchange. They reported the theft of 850000 bitcoins. 2. Transaction fees: The centralized crypt exchange transaction fees are high for convenience and services. This cost is high in the case of trades in high volume. Decentralized Crypto Exchange (DEX) Industry experts describe decentralized crypto exchanges as peer-to-peer marketplaces as they connect buyers and sellers. On DEX, the users have complete control over their holdings with their private keys for performing transactions. The smart contracts on the DEX are self-executing under pre-defined conditions. The blockchain ecosystem records each transaction. Decentralized crypto exchanges are speeding up the market for digital assets and developing new financial products. Pros of DEX: 1. Custody: The investors’ holdings on DEX are not custodial. It does not require investors to give private key rights to DEX for transactions. Investors can use external wallets with private keys with DEX through smart contracts. The terms of the contract are pre-defined. In the case of centralized exchanges, investors relinquish their custodial rights with the exchange, thus increasing the risk of hackers. 2. Diversity: There are many cryptocurrencies on decentralized exchanges. The decentralized crypto exchange often lists the cryptos with adequate trading activities, effective security standards, and prevalence for ensuring legal compliance and profitability. Most altcoins are traded on the exchanges, and P2P transactions are possible even with low trading volumes. 3. Lower Fees: As DEX uses self-executing smart contacts, there is an absence of an intermediary. DEX exchange, like Uniswap, charges low fees of around 0.3% compared to CEX. The transaction cost is lower than centralized exchanges in response to network utilization. 4. Trustless Transactions: Every transaction is recorded and overseen in CEX by the central controlling authority. But with DEX, trades are executed through smart contracts and recorded on the blockchain ecosystem, enabling trustless transactions. As DEX does not hold investor funds, the risk of hacking is low. 5. Privacy: In the case of DEX users, there is no need to disclose private keys as the exchange does not hold wallets or funds. Thus, there is no requirement for AML and KYC procedures. Even though it is convenient for investors, it might create problems from a legal perspective. Cons of DEX The cons of DEX significantly influence the user experience, scalability, capital mobility, and market liquidity. 1. User Experience: As DEX is at the developing stage, the users who are not familiar with the decentralized blockchain system might face difficulties. The first step for investors is to adopt the external wallet system to interact with DEX. They need to pump in funds in the wallet using Cryptocurrency or fiat money. Next, they need to link their wallet with DEX. In comparison, using a centralized exchange is a much easier process. 2. Liquidity: As DEX supports diverse trading pairs, it affects the market’s overall liquidity. In the Defi segment, market liquidity is increasing remarkably. 3. On and Off-Ramp: DEX does not support the purchase of digital assets using fiat currency like USD or allow fiat trade or making withdrawals from the bank account. Stablecoin technology is emerging for replacing fiat with the Defi ecosystem. Conclusion: Both kinds of crypto exchanges have their pros and cons. The centralized crypto exchanges are simple to use for investors but have hackers. Whereas decentralized crypto exchanges are more secure, they are not very user-friendly.

"What is Cryptocurrency? Basic Guide for Beginners","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-cryptocurrency/","Blog Post","24/09/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Everyone has been talking about cryptocurrencies, their legality, and whether or not it is a viable investment choice for the past few years. But what exactly is cryptocurrency? What technology has it implemented? This post will go over the fundamentals of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. What is Cryptocurrency? A cryptocurrency is distributed over the internet as a digital currency. These currencies are virtual currencies but with no central controlling authority. The transactions with cryptocurrencies are fast, direct, and seamless, irrespective of the geographical location of the transacting parties. It is like any other form of digital cash. The accounting of the transactions is done using a distributed ledger anyone can not alter. In simple words, we can describe cryptocurrencies as digital currencies created by the masses, controlled by the masses, and for the use of the masses. It has many advantages over fiat currencies. It is one of the main reasons the government and many banks are against introducing cryptocurrencies into the financial system. Blockchain is the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies. This technology is helpful in many applications, and cryptocurrency is one of its applications. The financial records kept by the banks and other financial institutions are susceptible to hacking. But as the record of cryptocurrency is kept using blockchain technology, supported by the cryptographic invention, the risk of hacking information is zero. What is Fiat Currency? The government backs fiat currencies. Examples of the fiat currencies are AUD (Australian Dollar), GBP (Great Britain Pound), USD (United States Dollar), JPY (Japanese Yen), CNY (Chinese Yen), and INR (Indian Rupee), etc. There are many advantages to the Fiat Currencies. As they are centralized, the central agencies can make them invalid with just a decision. For example, in 2016, India did a demonetization drive. Central authorities can print the currency at their desire, resulting in a rise in the inflation levels. The poor are becoming poorer because of the impact of inflation. Agencies like Master-card and Visa are required for the transactions with Fiat Currencies. People need to spend some fees to store their money in the banks. The transacting parties pay significant fees to mediator companies like Western Union to transfer funds across the borders. Cryptocurrencies are free from all the disadvantages, as mentioned earlier. The most significant advantage of cryptocurrency is that it has adopted distributed ledger backed by blockchain technology. What is the significance of blockchain? Blockchain technology stores the information in an irreversible chain of incorruptible blocks as a distributed ledger. They kept much valuable information in these ledgers. Record keeping plays a vital role in international diplomacy in the finance sector. What is Crypto Exchange? Crypto Exchange is a website where an investor can trade and exchange one cryptocurrency for another. These are the platforms only for the exchange of cryptos. These platforms do not allow investors to buy cryptos using Fiat currencies. Where cryptocurrencies can be purchased using Fiat currency. Earlier, only Bitcoins could be purchased in exchange for fiat. For buying other coins, investors need to transfer Bitcoins to crypto exchanges. But, now, investors can buy many cryptocurrencies from various websites for fiat currencies. Whether we could purchase cryptocurrencies using credit cards? CEX.IO is the most popular and convenient platform for buying Ethereum and Bitcoin using Paypal, credit cards, and bank accounts. Another available option is Changelly.com for buying cryptos using a credit card. Can investors store my funds somewhere else than exchange? Yes, investors can move the funds to personal wallets if they aim to hold some cryptos for a longer duration. What is the role of a wallet? Wallets have a structure similar to a bank account. It stores the public keys and corresponding private keys to receive and send cryptography funds. What are Public keys and private keys? We can compare the public key with the email username and the private key with the email’s password. Every wallet has pairs of public and private keys. If we want to have our email id, we have to open it with a service provider, say google for Gmail account. Your email id’s username and passwords are like the public key and private keys for sending and receiving the funds to your crypto wallet account. Final Thoughts: In this article, we discussed concepts like cryptocurrency, blockchain, wallet, and public and private keys. The following article will discuss different kinds of wallets, keys, and other exciting terms in the cryptocurrency industry. Please feel free to comment on your queries in the box below.

"What is Hyperledger Burrow and its Features?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-hyperledger-burrow-and-its-features/","Blog Post","17/09/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Do you want to see blockchain used in cross-industry applications with smart contracts? Then Hyperledger Burrow could be a good fit for you. What is Hyperledger Burrow, though? What distinguishes it? We’ll go over the features and benefits of Hyperledger Burrow in this article. Table of Contents • What Is Hyperledger? • What does Hyperledger Burrow deal with? • Features What Is Hyperledger? Hyperledger is an open-source blockchain that provides the required standards, framework, principles, and tools for use in various industries. The parties in this network are all familiar with one another. As a result, these parties are interested in reaching a consensus. What does Hyperledger Burrow deal with? Hyperledger is an open-source blockchain that provides the essential standards, framework, principles, and tools for use in various Hyperledger applications. Burrow is a permissioned blockchain platform for smart contract execution. Burrow intends to make blockchain implementation in cross-industry applications as simple as possible. Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm is used for the Hyperledger Burrow. It enables blockchains to grow up for commercial purposes while avoiding transaction and mining expenses. The network is administered by the Hyperledger Burrow software, which uses permissioned blockchain nodes. Transaction speed and throughput are higher in permissioned chains since all network members are trusted and known. Since the Ethereum public chain and Burrow share the same smart contract language, they can interact with each other. Features 1. Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI): Burrow-based smart contracts and chaincodes use the Application Blockchain interface to collaborate with Hyperledger’s consensus mechanisms. It does not require a unique adaptation code. 2. Consensus Engine: The consensus engine is crucial in preventing the Hyperledger blockchain from forking. Burrows uses the Byzantine-fault-tolerant Tendermint protocol, which is a similar consensus mechanism to Ethereum’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol. But, Burrow’s protocol is more secure than using the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. 3. Permissioned Ethereum Virtual Machine: Permissioned Ethereum Virtual Machine is the most crucial component of the Hyperledger Burrow. Identification of originally written code in Ethereum and its transaction can be performed using this feature. Ethereum blockchain smart contracts tend to function off the cryptocurrencies. Hyperledger Burrow gives a predetermined set of gas required for these smart contract functions. 4. Smart Contract Applications: In Hyperledger Burrow, the chaincodes or smart contract applications work under permissioned guidelines. In other words, the transactions conducted using smart contracts correspond back-office to a private and public key pair. This process is executed in a permissioned virtual machine. Hyperledger Burrow’s smart contracts are adaptable across networks. Two main advantages of Hyperledger Burrow: 1. Industry experts consider Burrow Redis of smart contract blockchains: Burrow has adopted licensed Ethereum Virtual Machine and leveraged speedily and hardened Tendermint protocol for consensus. These technical aspects give users access to the fastest codebases available. Burrow can process the transactions upwards at 200 transactions per second rate. Without any specialized hardware, the system becomes byzantine fault-tolerant because of adopting the proof of stake consensus protocol. 2. No Need for a VPN for Burrow permissions: Any network operator can create keys to perform actions within the range of blockchain networks. This feature means that the Burrow system gives access to the permissions system, a structured system. Future developments Hyperledger Burrow: One of the most crucial changes in the Burrow is including a governance transaction framework or govTx. This feature allows the network operators to alternative tokens, validator sets, permissions, etc., within the range of live networks. The upcoming versions of Burrow would work for more flexible on-chain governance primitives like validator set control of permissions, smart contracts upgrades using popular vote, token distribution, etc. In the context of the advanced applications, the Burrow maintainers have worked on the process of signing the transactions. These advancements would include the facility to implement the address-based signing using Burrow Deploy and transaction server either client or server-side. The future releases in Burrow would focus on the following areas and are considered significant. It has continued focus on operability and stability, including testing, hardening, security, and quality assurance of the codebase. Hyperledger Burrow’s permissioned EVM runtime would continue to complement a wide range of complex networks, including the enterprise blockchain world and the public blockchain sector. Agreements network built on Burrow would continue to perform. In the permissioned context, this activity ensures that Burrow remains the quickest and easiest way to run Ethereum contracts. In conclusion, Hyperledger Burrow can integrate back-office operations with current networks. In the future, organizations will start adopting Burrow to implement better business practices and enhance transparency in any industry. If you have more queries, please comment on the box below.

"What are Stablecoins? It’s features and benefits","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-are-stablecoins/","Blog Post","14/09/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Are you having trouble cashing out your digital assets to make payments? Are you concerned about the bitcoin industry’s price volatility? Then Stablecoins are an excellent choice for you. Let’s take a closer look at Stablecoins and their advantages. Even though the cryptocurrency market is still in its early stages, price volatility remains the biggest concern. Investors cannot hold cryptocurrencies for a consistent price and consider them as long-term investments. They can’t readily turn them into cash to make payments or transfer to banks. Stablecoins are crypto assets that can address both price volatility and usability issues. Because of their adaptability and durability, Stablecoins are becoming increasingly popular among seasoned investors and new crypto fans. What are Stablecoins? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies backed by stable assets at a 1:1 ratio. Every Stablecoin has a reserve of the backing asset. This reserve aids in the management of price volatility and allows it to be used in payments. USDC and Tether, for example, are linked to the US dollar, which means that their market prices will always be closer to the US dollar’s market value. Precious metals, commodities, and other stable assets can also be used to back the Stablecoin, such as Goldcoin, backed by a physical quantity of gold. The Stablecoin becomes non-volatile and more acceptable for payment since the issuer of the Stablecoin keeps a reserve of stable assets. Why are Stablecoins the preferred investment choice? Stablecoins maintains a balance between the fiat market and crypto markets. Thus, it enjoys a very high level of liquidity and low volatility. USDT (Tether) is used in more than seventy-five percent of Bitcoin trading due to its reliability and stability. High transaction volume also enhances its usefulness and liquidity for crypto investors in high, volatile market conditions. The features and benefits 1. Safe-Haven Assets: Precious metals like gold and commodities are historically sought-after “safe-haven” assets during times of volatility. From the historical period till today’s modern era, gold has maintained its place. Thus, Stablecoins backed by precious metals like gold and commodities is also considered a safe-haven asset. It gives investors the comfort of owning gold with additional benefits like increased liquidity, usability, and stability. 2. Remittance: Often, global companies face problems making payments to employees in diverse regions. Employers may access employees’ global pool. But, the question arises when their staff resides in many countries. The use of Stablecoin for making payments to the staff can be a good option in the new digital economy. 3. Payments: The payments using Stablecoins are borderless since they connect in real-time, global markets. For a worker residing in another country, adopting Stablecoins for remittances becomes a faster, cheaper, and more convenient option. 4. Trading: One additional advantage of using Stablecoins is access to the wide world of crypto markets. If an investor holds Stablecoins, it can quickly transfer them to other digital assets that can be used while participating in Initial Exchange Offerings (IEO), Defi applications, or joining meme competitions on Twitter for crypto prizes. 5. Escrow: The escrow process has become automated using smart contracts that evaluate the escrow conditions without any involvement of institutional intermediation. Stablecoin smart contracts are available on the blockchain, which is publicly auditable. As escrow smart contracts back Stablecoins, it gives price stability to the investors. 6. Lending: Stablecoin lending is considered one of the high-yield opportunities for debt investors. Massive institutional demand for Stablecoin loans has fueled this demand and tied it to trading. Stablecoin returns on the decentralized crypto lending platform are recorded as 15% highest against the 2.15 APY offered by the banks on the savings account. 7. Settlement: Often, payments are delayed due to the constraint of regular banking hours. Stablecoins can be operated 24/7 as they are based on the blockchain network and not on the business hours of centralized financial institutions. Money transfers could be done instantly using Stablecoins. Final Thoughts: The popularity of Stablecoins is increasing due to the rise in awareness about its benefits like the high speed of the transaction, lower processing speed, low price volatility, etc. In the following article, we will discuss more commodity Stablecoins.

"REIT or Real Estate Crowdfunding : Which Option is Better","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-are-reit-or-real-estate-crowdfunding/","Blog Post","12/09/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Are you a real estate investor interested in REITs or real estate crowdfunding? However, you have no idea the difference between these two alternatives. This article will explain the differences between REITs and real estate crowdfunding and which choice is better for investors. Let’s look at what a REIT is and how it works. What is REIT? REIT refers to a company that manages or owns income-producing commercial real estate. REITs invest in multifamily housing, hospitality, retail, student housing, senior living facilities, industrial, and self-storage, among other real estate types. How does it work? REITs function similarly to mutual funds. A REIT share is similar to a mutual fund unit in that it manages and owns rental properties. Real estate is not something that investors invest in. In some nations, it is required to pay out 90% of profits in dividends. Because REIT shares are tradable, they are fully liquid assets, with prices fluctuating throughout the day just like any other regular stock. As a result, prices may reflect the overall market trend without changing the REIT’s investment portfolio. Pros of REIT investment. 1. Portfolio Diversity: REITs generally manage thousands of properties, which means the practicability of the portfolio does not depend on the performance of one individual asset. 2. Liquidity: The shares of REITs can be purchased or sold easily with one click. The investment in the REIT provides liquidity to the investors. 3. Accessibility: The ownership barriers in REIT investment are less due to its availability in the stock market. 4. Management and strength: Professionals generally manage REITs with handsome experience in the commercial real estate industry. Usually, REITs bounce back quickly after a recession. 5. Limited Exposure: The risk exposure in investment in REIT is less than the risk associated with property ownership. REIT shares are one of the advisable options for risk-averse investors. Cons of REIT. Let us discuss them: 1. Limited control over the investment: The investors have little say in which properties they buy, refinance, repair, or sell. They are dependent on the management decisions of REITs. 2. Transparency: Most REIT investors are unaware of where their funds are invested. It becomes difficult for the investor to discern the performance of an individual property in the extensive portfolio of asset allocation. 3. Market fluctuations: The investment in REIT is subject to risk associated with the price fluctuations in the stock market, which is often more than the risk related to the valuation of an individual property. There is very little correlation between market fluctuation and personal property valuation. Now we know what REIT is and its advantages and disadvantages. But, first, let us look at what real estate crowdfunding is, how it works, and its pros and cons. What is Real Estate Crowdfunding? Fundraising for real estate projects by word of mouth and social media sharing. Real estate crowdfunding is done these days using internet platforms and apps to add blockchain technology. The crowdfunding platforms give exposure to investors from all over the world. Usually, there is a limit on minimum fund investment for the investors. This crowdfunding is used for both equity and debt for real estate deals. Equity fundraising is popular among investors. Advantages and disadvantages of real estate crowdfunding: 1. Transparency: While investing in real estate crowdfunding, the investor has information like the business plan, issuer’s financials, their ability of management, etc. 2. Direct Ownership: The investors get proportional ownership of the real estate the issuer is investing in. Such immediate right might not be possible for investors in their capacity due to significant funds for said project. 3. Potential High Returns: Generally, the crowdfunding option is used for real estate projects with a high valuation and scope of significant returns. Thus, the chances of good returns are more in the case of real estate crowdfunding. 4. Minimum Investment: Some crowdfunding platforms allow investors to invest with fewer funds, like $100. This strategy allows all investors to invest in real estate projects with a high valuation. Disadvantages of Real Estate crowdfunding. 1. Less liquidity: Most real estate crowdfunds need investors to commit for one, three, five, or even ten years. The investor’s money becomes illiquid for a set amount of time during the lock-in period. If investors want to stop investing in crowdsourcing, they may pay the penalty. 2. High Risk: As the lock-in period is long, the investment is exposed to the market and management efficiency risk. It is vital to study the due diligence of the project before investing. 3. Management Expertise: Real estate crowdfunding can be launched by any company irrespective of the need for an expert management system to take the fund’s investment decision. Which option, REIT or Real Estate Crowdfund, is the most suitable option for you? There is no right or wrong answer as both these investment options have pros and cons. However, the investor’s portfolio can witness value addition in both investment options. The risk-averse investors who prefer to maintain liquidity should opt for the REIT investment. On the other hand, the investors who can take a high risk have more chances of earning considerable profits. The investment amount will depend on their requirement for liquid funds and risk-taking capacity. If you have more queries, please comment on the box below.

"What determines the Value of Cryptocurrency?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-value-of-cryptocurrency/","Blog Post","08/09/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","The value of cryptocurrency is a hotly debated topic. Some people swear that one cryptocurrency is worth a lot more than another. Others claim that cryptocurrency is a waste of time and energy. The truth lies somewhere in the middle – cryptocurrency is a highly speculative market, meaning that a single coin’s value can change quite quickly. Value of Cryptocurrency Since its inception, the bitcoin price has shown a wide fluctuation range. In 2017, its price witnessed massive gains from $1000, reaching its peak at $19000. A dip follows this high price in 2018 and stability in 2019. The question arises, what drives its value and why significant investment is made in this market. This article will discuss this query and understand the underlying value of Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency. What does ""intrinsic value"" mean? In layman’s language, intrinsic value means the value of a commodity or product possesses in itself. There is no need for additional sources to provide value to the underlying item or product. For example, bitterness is the intrinsic value of a bitter gourd. Any item gains its value by the price people are ready to pay. We do transactions by exchanging fiat currency for goods and services in today’s world. This exchange is that the fiat currency can be reused to obtain goods and services. Some currencies are backed by an equal value of precious metals like silver and gold with intrinsic value. But nowadays, most of the currencies. worldwide are Fiat Currencies. What is Fiat Currency? Fiat currency is not strengthened by any physical commodity like silver or gold, and the government issues it. International agencies evaluate the value of fiat currency with factors like the stability of the government and the relationship between demand and supply taken into consideration. The relationship between demand and supply is calculated using that currency with network participants. For example, suppose I trade $100 notes for purchasing vegetables within a network by exchanging the currency worth $100 for the grocery. With these $100 notes, the storekeeper buys his meal or invests elsewhere to create more value. Thus, Fiat currency or money generates exchange value with the government’s backing. Like any fiat currency, Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency is not strengthened by silver or gold, so it does not have intrinsic value. Instead, the value of any currency is established by the trust that people have in the government and the backing of the state. This logic shows that for creating the exchange value within the network, it is crucial for the network to have faith, regardless of who or what is backing it. The value of Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency gains its value precisely in the same manner mentioned above. The trust of the millions of investors in the cryptocurrency in an entirely trustless environment determines the cryptocurrency’s value. Participants in the bitcoin network are millions of traders and miners who trust the world’s highly traded cryptocurrency and ascertain its price based on the network’s principles and demand and supply What is a network effect in the ecosystem of any currency? In recent years, the popularity of the electronic payment mode is increasing over the traditional transaction method as it involves minimum use of direct value exchange between two parties via the digital medium. Other reasons for the acceleration in popularity are transparency, ease, and accuracy. In addition, digital payments can be tressed easily. Due to the launch of payment apps and wallet apps like Google Pay, Paytm, PhonePe, etc., cashless payment modes have caught grip. This surge in digital transactions denotes the network effect that highlights the rise in the value of the assets with the increase in the number of people utilizing them. Even though the routine transactions are made digitally swift, the same is not the case with large or overseas transactions due to the time involved in the transactions subjected to a highly volatile exchange rate. Cryptocurrencies solve the problems in large transactions due to their features like decentralized infrastructure, ease in the direct money transfers, traceable, quick, immutable, and transparent. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies would get more value with the rise in their adoption due to the adherence to the principles of the network effect. For example, a single phone was not of any use. But, after the surge in the use of phones, their value has increased exponentially. Intrinsic value from the economic point of view In economics, it should have two essential characteristics, namely Scarcity and Utility, for gaining value to any commodity. Scarcity denotes a limited supply of goods and services. Many cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, are fixed, meaning a finite number of these currencies are available in the market. According to the law of demand and supply, the scarcity of bitcoin results in a surge in its desirability over other assets like gold. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are entirely digital and have all the advantages of a digital mode of transaction, such as less time for completing the transaction. In addition, cryptocurrency is considered a critical mode of factors like transaction time and transactional cost. However, as only two parties are involved in the cryptocurrency transaction, the transaction cost is minimal, just like a cash transaction. Compared with the transaction time engaged in the traditional fiat currencies, the cryptocurrency transaction is effortless and prompt. Global e-commerce companies like Amazon have millions of transactions. These companies have started accepting payments using bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies. In conclusion, with the rise in the adoption of electronic modes of payment, cryptocurrencies can perform seamless and swift transactions. Therefore, as more and more people accept cryptocurrencies as a payment mode, their value would also increase as a solid alternative for money. © Thank You! 1Abc Directory Related","[Basics]","NULL"

Today, ~50% of global remittance is sent in cash, which is expensive and dangerous. Using Ravencoin, these transactions can be digitally recorded, providing a secure, transparent method of transferring funds. Ravencoin blockchain is focused on asset production and peer-to-peer transmission. Due to its unique algorithm, Ravencoin (RVN) can be mined with a standard computer. Cryptocurrency mining, such as Bitcoin mining, is often costly and energy-intensive. It necessitates the use of specialized gear. Difference between Ravencoin and Bitcoin. Ravencoin operates on its blockchain, even though it is a Bitcoin fork. Following are the main differences between these two networks. Block time: Ravencoin's block time is one-tenth of Bitcoin's in one minute. Issuance schedule: Bitcoin mining reward began with 50 BTC whereas, in the case of Ravencoin, it started at 5000 RVN. Coin Supply: There is a total supply of 21 mln BTC against 21 bln RVN. Mining Algorithm: Ravencoin uses the X16R algorithm, whereas Bitcoin implements the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. Ravencoin algorithm prevents ASIC mining. Why investment in Ravencoin is a good option? A growing Mining and low fees for RVN: Ravenoin fees are exceptionally low compared to the Ethereum users. This trend is expected to continue in the future also. A fully developed and functional blockchain: Ethereum undergoes a massive and constant transformation state. These transformations mean the risk of something big can happen. On the other hand, Ravencoin is a fully functional and developed blockchain. Even though developers would work on its improvement, the risk of massive transformation in the base layer is low. The risk of RVN being classified as security is low: Ravencoin is a decentralized project with a fair launch. RVN is fairly launched because it has no fundraising, ICO, pre-mining, corporate structure like a foundation or any official leadership, etc. In addition to these aspects, all coins are issued by proof of work (POW) mining. A Great Vision: The common threads among early Ravencoin supporters and creators are liberty, land rights, healthy free markets, ideals of individual freedom, etc. These ideals have a cohesive and profound vision for blockchain technology, digital securities, and asset tokenization. Vision Behind the Ravencoin: The creators of Ravencoin have an idea while developing it as a fork of Bitcoin. They ensured that Ravencoin is an open-source project, analyzing the advantages of the open-source approach.

"What is CryptoPunks, The Most Expensive NFT","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-cryptopunks-nft/","Blog Post","02/09/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","CryptoPunks is one of the first famous NFT projects, which have collectible pieces of crypto art, backed by NFTs. These NFTs are on the Ethereum blockchain. There are 8-Bit-style, 10000 small punks with unique features. This crypto has attracted many crypto artists. For digital collectibles, it has also inspired the development of the ERC-721 token standard. When some punks earned millions of dollars, the popularity of some CryptoPunks has increased by 2021. What is CryptoPunks NFT? CryptoPunks are 24×24 pixel images, denoted as art. These images are mostly punky-looking females and males, with the rare types mixed within. Some of them are even Aliens, Apes, and Zombies. The most fascinating fact is that each punk has unique features, which is the reason for its high valuation in the market. It is a new and innovative form of asset tokenization. Investors can check their website for traits or characteristics of every single punk and its price at that moment. Another trait about these CryptoPunks is that there are only 10,000 and developers are not making more or controlling punk’s circulation. Before becoming famous, the company gave the punks for free. So, any investor with an Ethereum wallet can get the punks. Background behind CryptoPunks In 2017, CryptoPunks were released as the first non-fungible token (NFT). With nothing serious in mind, Matt Hall and John Watkinson from Larva Labs have started this project as an experiment. This project has developed completely differently than planned. The inspiration behind this project is the novel Neuromancer, and the movie Blade Runner. They developed this project as a fun for entertainment purpose. In reality, ERC-721 inspired the punks that are close to the ERC-20 token. What does Dev Punk mean? When the company offered the 10000 punks, the blockchain developers claimed the first 1000 punks. They offered the Remaining 9000 punks to random people. The developers can buy or sell these CryptoPunks. Every CryptoPunk between 1-1000 is termed as Dev Punk. Types of CryptoPunks NFT There are 5 primary types of CryptoPunks NFT, namely female, male, zombie, ape, and alien. Various attributes or accessories characterize these types of punks. These punks have value based on their type, irrespective of their accessories. As there are 6039 punks, they are not rare as compared with other types of punks. Whereas, alien punks are really rare, as there are only 9 punks, out of which they sold punk 3100 at a price of $10.67M. In the similar manner, there are only 88 zombie punks and 24 ape punks. More so, 3840 punks. This scenario has resulted in a rise in the value of female punks with rare accessories. Trading CryptoPunks Investors can trade the punks at two places, namely Larva Labs and OpenSea. If investors want to buy or sell the punks on OpenSea, they need to wrap these punks, as OpenSea can’t process the ERC-20, and works with ERC-721 tokens. Wrapped punks are also available in other NFT marketplaces. Due to low maintenance, investors may end in purchasing a fake punk. Let us see what Wrapping is? Wrapping process involves specific wallet and contracts support beneficial to wrap the punks. The first step is that the investor needs to send the punk to a wrapped contract, which will be stored in an escrow. Investors will get ERC721 token, specifying the CryptoPunk. They can use this token in buying or selling the punks. Investors can unwrap the token conveniently and can get the punk back stored in escrow. This method offers many decentralized finance applications to use these punks and increases the liquidity of the token. Now, we will see step by step how to buy CryptoPunk. Step1: Buy Ether First, you need to buy Ether necessary for buying a punk. A cryptocurrency exchange can convert the cash into Ether and store it in the wallet. It is advisable to buy Ether from the big and trusted crypto exchanges. Step 2: Transfer Ether to wallet MetaMask wallet is a popular blockchain wallet to store Ether and trade in NFT marketplaces. As CryptoPunks supports MetaMask, you need to create an account with it as well. Step 3: Connect with Larva Labs Investors can buy or sell the CryptoPunks at the primary market, Larva Labs. Or you can also get these punks from OpenSea. On both platforms, investors get the link to connect the wallet with the platform. Step 4: Choose the CryptoPunk and purchase it All the punks are not always available for sale. So, it is advisable to go through the options, analyze the attributes, and choose the punks. One decided the punk, bid on that punk, if your bid is perfect, you will own the punk. Final Thoughts Industry experts regard CryptoPunks as a revolutionary addition to the NFT spectrum.

"What is DeFi ( Decentralized Finance) in Cryptocurrency And How to Make Money with DeFi?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-defi/","Blog Post","02/09/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","What is Decentralized Finance (DeFi)? Decentralized finance (DeFi) is gaining massive attraction from investors in cryptocurrencies. Now, the question arises: what does Defi refer to? How to make money with DeFi? Can we earn passive income with Defi? The answer is Yes. In simple words, Defi refers to the financial services executed with the help of smart contracts without the involvement of intermediaries like lawyers or banks. These contracts use online blockchain technology. As the name suggests, Defi is a community-driven financial services platform decentralized, designed to be trustless and permissionless. There are no AML and KYC requirements, so Defi targets banked and non-banked participants in smart contracts. Defi investors can also earn passive and active income from their investments like traditional investment options. Investors can earn active income by trading their assets on Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchanges (DEX). In contrast, they can achieve passive income where crypto holders and investors earn income without active trade. How participants can make money with DeFi in four ways: Yield Farming Liquidity Mining Staking Lending Let us review these theories in more detail. Yield Farming: In this method, the investors earn cryptos with their cryptos. In simple words, they lend their funds as cryptos using smart contracts. They make fees as cryptos as income. The yield farmers often adopt complicated strategies to churn their cryptos in various lending marketplaces to maximize the returns. These strategies involve staking tokens in a string of protocols for generating maximum yield. However, the yield farmers rarely disclose their yield farming strategies, as the approach might prove ineffective if more people know about it. The yield farmers stake stable coins like Tether (USDT), Dai, or USD Coin (USDC). The yield farmers try to adopt new ventures as they can benefit more because of the value of appreciation. They use the considerable weight of initial capital for earning significant profits. However, the risk is involved in this investment. The risk associated with smart contract code and the capability of project teams can take away the potential gains. In addition, as the smart contracts are unaudited, their code might contain bugs and vulnerable attackers. Liquidity Mining: Some decentralized exchanges like SushiSwap and Uniswap allow swaps between token pairs like USDT and ETH. Liquidity providers (LPs) are ordinary Defi users. They offer their tokens into the pool controlled by smart contracts, creating liquidity for decentralized exchanges. In return, LPs earn a 0.3% fee from the swaps, proportional to their contribution to the pool on Uniswap’s DEX. LP earnings increase with more trades made. The profits of LPs cannot be guaranteed, as the fluctuations in one of the pooled tokens might swipe away the profits earned. This loss is termed impermanent loss (IL). To minimize the edge of loss, LPs choose highly liquid pools having less volatile assets like ETH/WBTC. LPs take the help of LP aggregators to analyze data available on a real-time basis and maximize returns from various pools. Staking: Staking involves locking funds in a Cryptocurrency wallet to enhance the security and operations of a blockchain network to receive rewards. In most cases, the investors can stake their cryptos directly into a Trust wallet. Whereas some exchanges also provide staking services to their investors. There are different ways of calculating the staking reward by blockchain networks. For example, some networks calculate on a block-by-block basis, considering various factors like how long the validator is staking actively, the number of coins the validator is staking, the inflation rate, the total number of coins staked on the network, etc. In contrast, sometimes validators earn a fixed percentage of reward from the network as compensation for generating volatility in the network. In this model, validators can calculate the reward they would earn. Lending: The users earn an APY (annual percentage yield) from the lending platforms for bolting their assets into a smart contract. Borrowers then use these tokens and pay interest for operating funds. They returned a portion of this interest to the lender. Smart contracts govern the entire transaction of lending and borrowing. This contract minimizes the risk associated with the non-payment of a debt by the borrower. Thus, the lender can withdraw the funds. As per research, the interest rate for crypto lending loans is always as high as 8% against a 1% return on fiat currencies. This method is beneficial to lenders as a passive income source and for borrowers. They can short a fund by buying it on one exchange and selling it on another, thus earning margin trading. Crypto loans are eligible for arbitrage trading for both borrowers and lenders. Between a Centralized Exchange and a Decentralized Exchange, arbitrage trading is done. Traders borrow dollars at a lower rate than DEX for this transaction and use it on CEX for crypto. The lenders can lend it to the DEX to earn an arbitrage fee. Because of underpinned Blockchain technology, there is transparency in the fund movements. Some well-known Defi lending exchanges are Dharma, MakerDAO, and Compound. In Conclusion Investment in Defi is an excellent option to earn passive income. But it is advisable to understand the risks involved. You should invest only that much fund which you can afford to lose. If you have any queries, then please comment in the box below.

"What is Digital Asset Tokenization in blockchain technology?","https://blockchainshiksha.com/what-is-digital-asset-tokenization-blockchain-technology/","Blog Post","01/09/2021","SHUBHADA PANDE, ","Are you curious about what is the role of asset tokenization in crowdfunding? What are the advantages of blockchain-backed tokenization? Then, you are in an appropriate place. In this article, we will discuss tokenization and its benefits. What is Asset Tokenization? Some years back, it was a challenging task for a project to raise funds. However, this condition has changed because of the proliferation of blockchain technology, as it enabled the global community to take part in crowdfunding using smart contracts. Independent of fundraising, whether it is bank funding, self-funding and venture funding, etc. The traditional financing system is a cumbersome and complicated process. Among these types of fundraising, venture capital is not possible without an already launched product. Adoption of the blockchain in crowdfunding has made this process transparent, safe and accessible worldwide. Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is one of the popular ways of fundraising. In ICO, the startups can create their smart contracts on the blockchain platform and launch their cryptocurrencies for fundraising. Investors can invest their funds in buying the crypto-equities just like stocks in crypto exchanges. The value of the crypto-equities fluctuates with the company’s performance. But the major problem with capital raising with crowdfunding is that it needs a team of blockchain experts. After completing the ICO, the expenditure made on the ICO activities becomes a waste for the startup companies. It is an additional expenditure for the startups. Funds are needed to develop the complete ecosystem of blockchain experts, ICO advisors, and technical infrastructure. Because of these factors, many startups opt for readymade platforms. Entrepreneurs and investors also adopt the crowdfunding process to focus on the actual business requirements. Tokenization is also a kind of crowdfunding. It implies representing any rights or assets into a digital replica, i.e., token. Even before the emergence of blockchain technology, tokenization was done. However, blockchain technology gives an infrastructure layer to token stored, programmed, transferred, or recorded securely and transparently. Kinds of Tokens from a functional perspective. Security Tokens These tokens are identical to the traditional securities like shares, debt, or stock of any company. Companies use STO or security token offerings for issuing these tokens with certain rights. In most jurisdictions, securities law regulates security tokens. Like other securities, security tokens are available outside the trading platforms, and their value is subject to speculation. Either an off-chain asset (like real estate, commercial documents, art, etc represents security tokens) or an on-chain asset. Someone can tokenize anything having value, for example, intellectual property, data, and income-based rights. For example: Investors can invest in STO of real estate tokens. They can predict their investment value that would appreciate with an increase in the property price. Utility Token Utility tokens are beneficial in safeguarding the participation in bulk sales for raising capital on a project. A company issues the utility tokens when they intend to create a coupon, exchanged in the future for availing their services. The price of the utility tokens is constantly fluctuating, which enhances the chances of profits for the investors. Currency/Payment Tokens These tokens are exchanged or used for payments just like a currency. Similar to fiat currencies, currency tokens are also traded for other fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies via self-hosted digital wallets or centralized or decentralized exchanges. A famous example of a currency token is Bitcoin; the government does not regulate. Now the question arises whether an investment in tokens is beneficial? Benefits of Digital Asset Tokenization Adopting DTL results in an immutable proof of security, ownership, and transparency STOs and tokens are shared, immutable, and distributed ledger because of their underlying blockchain infrastructure. This ledger serves as a trustworthy source of information. Token holders have access to data like their rights, who they are dealing with, who has owned the token previously, etc. This level of security and transparency enhances user confidence. Increase in liquidity and access Tokenization easily converts the illiquid assets into a tradable financial investment, which can be offered using Security Token Offering (STO). Tokenization enables a single asset to be a help or controlled or owned by many investors fractionally. Any investor with an internet connection can opt for tokens, subject to regulatory considerations. The issuing company gets a more diverse and broader set of investors. Another benefit of investment in a token is its traceability in the secondary market like digital exchanges, over-the-counter desks, etc., that are internet-based and open for 24*7 tradings, eliminating barriers like geographical locations and time zone. Automated versatility and compliance with programmable tokens smart contracts backed tokens, with self-executable code lines deployed n a blockchain. Smart contracts enable automated compliance and security, like KYC, to ensure compliance. This system also provides the dividend and interest payment coded into the tokens. Better speed and efficiency Due to smart contracts, the transactions in tokenized assets are performed on a real-time basis, eliminating the post-trade reconciliation. Automation reduces the additional burden of administrative tasks and promotes disintermediation, resulting in reduced cost with higher efficiency. Even though there are many advantages to tokenization, we cannot ignore its disadvantages. There is no legal and regulatory infrastructure for tokenization, leading investors and entrepreneurs to remain wary of the regulatory front. Smart contracts, an essential characteristic of the tokenization model, have uncertain legal status, projecting it as a hurdle in adopting these technologies. In conclusion, tokenization of assets is beneficial for issuing companies and investors. Issuing companies can raise funds from a broader range of investors irrespective of their time zone and location. Investors can gain from the fluctuating prices of various kinds of tokens in the secondary market. These profits are possible because of the adoption of smart contracts backed by the blockchain.© Follow us on LinkedIn for more insights. Thank You! Related","[Blockchain]","NULL"
